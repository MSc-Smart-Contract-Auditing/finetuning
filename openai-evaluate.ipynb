The code is not checking if the `accountPrimeStorageValue` is within the valid range of `int256` type. \\\\n\\\\nAn attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a large value for `accountPrimeStorageValue` that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an `int256` variable. This could lead to an integer overflow, causing the `netPrimeDebtChange` variable to wrap around and potentially result in unexpected behavior or even a contract crash.\\\\n\\\\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `repayAccountPrimeDebtAtSettlement` function with a large value for `accountPrimeStorageValue`, which would cause the `netPrimeDebtChange` variable to overflow and potentially lead to unexpected behavior or a contract crash.\\n\\nGround truth:\\nThe `repayAccountPrimeDebtAtSettlement()` function is responsible for calculating the residual cash to be refunded to a user when settling a Vault Account. However, an incorrect calculation of the `primeCashRefund` value is performed, resulting in the loss of the user's residual cash. Specifically, the code contains a logical error in the calculation of `primeCashRefund`, where the subtraction operation is performed on the `netPrimeDebtChange` variable, which is set to `accountPrimeStorageValue` instead of the intended `netPrimeDebtRepaid` value. This causes the `primeCashRefund` value to always equal 0, effectively preventing the refund of the residual cash to the user.\",\n",
