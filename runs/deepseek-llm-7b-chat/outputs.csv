0,"There is a vulnerability in the code. The vulnerability is in the `TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash` function. The function does not properly check if the account has enough prime cash to withdraw. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash` function with a large amount of prime cash, which could potentially cause the account to go into debt. The attacker could then use the debt to their advantage, such as by forcing the account to pay back the debt with prime cash, which could be used to drain the account's prime cash.","The `repayAccountPrimeDebtAtSettlement()` function is responsible for calculating the residual cash to be refunded to a user when settling a Vault Account. However, an incorrect calculation of the `primeCashRefund` value is performed, resulting in the loss of the user's residual cash. Specifically, the code contains a logical error in the calculation of `primeCashRefund`, where the subtraction operation is performed on the `netPrimeDebtChange` variable, which is set to `accountPrimeStorageValue` instead of the intended `netPrimeDebtRepaid` value. This causes the `primeCashRefund` value to always equal 0, effectively preventing the refund of the residual cash to the user."
1,"Vulnerability: Unprotected access to snapshot data\n\nDescription: In the first codeblock, the function _snapshot() is defined without any input parameters. This means that it will always return the same value, which is the result of calling _snapshot() itself. This can lead to a vulnerability because it allows an attacker to manipulate the returned value by calling _snapshot() multiple times with different arguments.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call _snapshot() multiple times with different arguments, such as a large number of tokens, to manipulate the returned value and gain control over the protection pool's current investors.\n\nVulnerability: Unprotected access to snapshot data\n\nDescription: In the second codeblock, the function claimableUnlockedCapital() takes four input parameters, but it does not check if the input parameters are valid. This can lead to a vulnerability because an attacker can pass invalid input parameters, such as a zero value for the snapshotId parameter, to manipulate the returned value and gain control over the protection pool's claimable unlocked capital.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call the claimableUnlockedCapital() function with invalid input parameters, such as a zero value for the snapshotId parameter, to manipulate the returned value and gain control over the protection pool's claimable unlocked capital.","The `lockCapital` mechanism in the ProtectionPool contract is vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker who can exploit the predictability of the timestamp when the pool switches to the `Late` state. This allows the attacker to use a flash loan from a secondary market, such as Uniswap, to claim a share of the potential unlock of capital.\n\nThe attacker can predict the timestamp when the pool will switch to `Late` and use this information to call the `assessState` function, which is publicly callable. This triggers the pool to move from the `Active/LateWithinGracePeriod` state to the `Late` state, causing the `lockCapital` function to be executed on the ProtectionPool.\n\nThe attacker can then use the flash loan to acquire the sTokens at the predicted timestamp, effectively becoming the holder of record for the sTokens at the snapshot taken by the ProtectionPool. This allows the attacker to claim the locked funds at the potential unlock, as the claimable amount is calculated based on the snapshot balance of the attacker's sTokens.\n\nThe attacker's ability to manipulate the `lockCapital` mechanism is facilitated by the fact that the `lockCapital` function is triggered by the `assessState` function, which is publicly callable. This allows the attacker to predict the timestamp when the pool will switch to `Late` and take advantage of the situation by acquiring the sTokens at the predicted timestamp."
2,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The vulnerability occurs when the `_invariant` function is bypassed for protected position updates, allowing an attacker to exploit the system by sending a large number of pending position updates. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as the system becomes overwhelmed by the excessive pending updates.\n\nThe `_invariant` function checks for a limit on the number of pending position updates, but this check is bypassed for protected position updates. This allows an attacker to send a large number of pending updates, which can cause the system to become overwhelmed and eventually revert with an error.\n\nThe `_settle` function is responsible for settling the pending position updates, but it does not check for the limit on pending updates. This means that an attacker can continue to send pending updates, causing the system to become increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nThe `update` function is the entry point for updating positions, and it calls the `_settle` function before updating the positions. This means that the system will become overwhelmed by pending updates, leading to a denial-of-service attack.\n\nThe attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of pending position updates, which will cause the system to become overwhelmed and eventually revert with an error."

4,"There is a vulnerability in the Solidity code. The vulnerability is in the `settle` function of the contract, specifically in the `_settle` function.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the settlement process and steal self-liquidation fees. The attacker can do this by self-liquidating and then immediately settling the contract, which will result in the stolen self-liquidation fees being claimed by the attacker.\n\nTo take advantage of the vulnerability, an attacker would need to have control over the contract's owner or a user account that can self-liquidate. The attacker would then self-liquidate, wait for a short period of time, and then settle the contract. The stolen self-liquidation fees would be claimed by the attacker.","The vulnerability arises when the account being liquidated or referred is the same as the account's own address. During the market settlement process, the `local.claimable` storage is credited to the liquidator or referral's account. However, the in-memory cached copy of the account's local storage is not updated to reflect the changes made to `local.claimable` during the settlement process. This cached copy is then saved to storage, effectively discarding the updated `local.claimable` value.\n\nAs a result, when the account is the same as the liquidator or referral, the liquidation or referral fees are lost, as the updated `local.claimable` value is not reflected in the cached copy. This issue occurs because the cached copy of the account's local storage is overwritten after the settlement process, discarding the updated `local.claimable` value.\n\nThe `_storeContext` function stores the cached copy of the account's local storage, which is not updated to reflect the changes made to `local.claimable` during the settlement process. This leads to the loss of liquidation or referral fees when the account is the same as the liquidator or referral."
5,"Vulnerability: Double spending\n\nDescription:\nThe code checks if a delegation has been purchased using the `_isPurchased` mapping. If the delegation has been purchased, it increases the total delegated amount for the holder's address using the `_totalDelegated` mapping. If the total delegated amount is equal to or greater than the purchased amount, it calls the `purchasedToUnlocked` function.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating two separate delegations with the same `delegationId` but different `holder` addresses. The first delegation is created with a small amount, which is not enough to unlock any features. The second delegation is created with a larger amount, which is enough to unlock the features.\n\nThe attacker then calls the `_isPurchased` mapping to check if the second delegation has been purchased. Since the `_isPurchased` mapping only checks if the delegation has been purchased, it will return true for the second delegation. The attacker then calls the `_totalDelegated` mapping to increase the total delegated amount for the holder's address. Since the total delegated amount is now equal to or greater than the purchased amount, the `purchasedToUnlocked` function is called, unlocking the features for the second delegation.\n\nThe attacker can then transfer the unlocked funds from the second delegation to their own address, double spending the funds.\n\nSolution:\nTo prevent double spending, the code should check if the delegation has been unlocked using the `_isUnlocked` mapping before calling the `purchasedToUnlocked` function. If the delegation has not been unlocked, the function should return without unlocking any features.","This vulnerability occurs when the tokens are not properly unlocked after the delegation period ends. Specifically, the tokens are only unlocked if at least 50% of the tokens purchased during the initial launch are undelegated, rather than all tokens being unlocked after three months since at least 50% of tokens are delegated. This discrepancy can lead to inconsistent and unexpected behavior in the token unlocking mechanism.\n\nThe code snippet provided, which is part of the delegation logic, appears to be the root cause of this issue. The condition `if (_totalDelegated[holder] >= _purchased[holder])` checks if the total delegated tokens for a holder exceeds the total purchased tokens, and if so, calls the `purchasedToUnlocked` function. However, this condition is only met if the holder has undelegated at least 50% of the tokens purchased during the initial launch, rather than all tokens being unlocked after the three-month mark."
6,"There is a vulnerability in the code. The function `isBlackListed` checks if an address is in the `_isBlackListedBot` mapping, which is a public view function. This means that an attacker can easily check if their address is blacklisted by calling the function with their address as the argument. If their address is blacklisted, the function will return `true`, otherwise it will return `false`.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call the `isBlackListed` function with their address as the argument to check if they are blacklisted. If they are not blacklisted, they can use this information to their advantage in some way.",
7,"There is a vulnerability in the `claimLoanNFT` function. The function checks if the sender of the transaction is the lender by comparing the sender's address with `bid.lender`. However, it does not check if the sender is the owner of the contract. An attacker could call the `claimLoanNFT` function with a different address as the sender, and the vulnerability would allow the attacker to claim the NFT even if they are not the lender.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could call the `claimLoanNFT` function with a different address as the sender, and the vulnerability would allow the attacker to claim the NFT even if they are not the lender.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the `setLenderManager` function or the `getLoanLender` function.","The `setLenderManager` function, used to update the lender manager address of a contract, can lead to unintended consequences when combined with the `claimLoanNFT` and `getLoanLender` functions. Specifically, when the lender manager is changed, repaid assets will be sent to the old lender manager, potentially resulting in the loss of assets belonging to the original lender.\n\nThis issue arises because the `claimLoanNFT` function updates the `bid.lender` variable to point to the new lender manager, while the `getLoanLender` function relies on this variable to determine the lender's identity. When the lender manager is changed, the `getLoanLender` function will incorrectly identify the old lender manager as the lender, leading to the repaid assets being sent to the wrong address.\n\nIn the `getLoanLender` function, the `lender_` variable is initially set to the value of `bid.lender`, which is the address of the lender manager. However, when the lender manager is changed, this value remains outdated, causing the function to return the old lender manager's address instead of the correct lender's address. As a result, the repaid assets are sent to the old lender manager, rather than the original lender, resulting in a loss of assets."
8,"Vulnerability: Integer Overflow\n\nDescription:\nThe Solidity codeblock checks if the currentAllowance is greater than or equal to subtractedValue. However, it does not perform any type checking or overflow protection on the values being compared. If the values of currentAllowance and subtractedValue are large enough, an integer overflow could occur, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\nAttacking Vector:\nAn attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the values of currentAllowance and subtractedValue to cause an integer overflow. For example, the attacker could set currentAllowance to a very large value and subtractedValue to a very small value, causing an overflow and potentially leading to the execution of unintended code or the disclosure of sensitive information.","The vulnerability allows a malicious spender to manipulate the token allowance by front-running calls to modify the allowance, leading to unintended spending and denial-of-service attacks. This occurs due to a race condition in the `ERC20::approve` implementation and its variants, which update the allowance mapping in storage.\n\nWhen a spender updates their allowance to a value less than the current allowance, a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by front-running the update transaction. This allows the spender to spend the existing allowance plus any additional allowance set by the in-flight transaction, exceeding the intended limit.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where Alice approves Bob for 100 tokens, and then decides to decrease the allowance to 50. A malicious actor can front-run the update transaction, allowing Bob to spend the entire 100 tokens. When Alice's transaction executes, Bob's allowance is updated to 50, but the malicious actor can still spend the remaining 50 tokens, resulting in a total of 100 tokens spent, exceeding the intended limit of 50.\n\nThe `decreaseTokenAllowance` functions, introduced in the `TokenFacet` and `ApprovalFacet`, are susceptible to this vulnerability. These functions halt execution and revert when the caller attempts to decrease the allowance below zero, rather than setting the allowance to zero. This allows a malicious actor to force the execution to revert, violating the intention of the caller to decrease the allowance.\n\nIn another scenario, Alice approves Bob for 100 tokens, and then decides to decrease the allowance to 50. A malicious actor can front-run the update transaction, spending 60 tokens. When Alice's transaction executes, it reverts due to the allowance being decreased below zero. The malicious actor can then spend the remaining 40 tokens, resulting in a total of 100 tokens spent, exceeding the intended limit of 50."
9,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"When a user initiates a rollover, they are expected to receive the total amount of shares they are entitled to, including any winnings from the previous epoch. However, the `mintRollovers` function does not accurately reflect this expectation. Instead, it mints only the original assets requested for rollover, without considering the user's winnings.\n\nThe issue arises when the function checks if the user won the previous epoch and proceeds to burn all the shares they requested to roll. Although the user is entitled to receive the total amount of shares, including their winnings, the function only mints the original assets, leaving the user with an incomplete share of their winnings.\n\nThis discrepancy occurs because the function mints `assetsToMint`, which is calculated as the difference between the original assets requested for rollover and the relayer fee, rather than the total amount of shares the user is entitled to. As a result, the user is unable to claim their winnings from the previous epoch, which is a critical aspect of the rollover process.\n\nIn contrast, when a user withdraws their shares, the `withdraw` function accurately reflects their total entitlement, including their winnings, by burning the original assets and sending the entitled shares. This highlights the inconsistency in the `mintRollovers` function, which fails to provide the user with their complete winnings."
10,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this Solidity codeblock, the function `_decreaseCurrentMinted` is responsible for updating the current minted count for a given account. The function is marked as `internal virtual`, which means it can be overridden by child contracts.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `_decreaseCurrentMinted` function in a way that triggers a reentrancy attack. The attacker can call the function from a contract that has already called the function before, causing the function to be called again, and potentially leading to an infinite loop.\n\nFor example, consider the following sequence of events:\n\n1. An attacker calls `_decreaseCurrentMinted` from a contract that has already called it before.\n2. The function is called again, and the current minted count is updated.\n3. The attacker then calls `_decreaseCurrentMinted` again, triggering a reentrancy attack.\n\nIn this scenario, the attacker can manipulate the current minted count to their advantage, potentially causing the contract to mint more tokens than intended.","The vulnerability lies in the way the `currentMinted` value is updated when the Vault burns TAU tokens. Specifically, when the Vault acts on behalf of a user to burn TAU, the `_decreaseCurrentMinted` function is called, which incorrectly updates the `currentMinted` value.\n\nThe issue arises because the function subtracts the `accountMinted` value from `currentMinted[msg.sender]`, where `accountMinted` is the current minted value for the account that is burning the TAU. However, when the Vault is acting on behalf of the user, the `account` variable does not match the `msg.sender`, resulting in `accountMinted` being set to 0. Consequently, the `currentMinted` value for the Vault is not reduced, rendering the mint limit ineffective.\n\nFurthermore, this vulnerability can be exploited by users who transfer their TAU between accounts. In such cases, the `amount` burned may exceed the `accountMinted` value, which would not trigger the `amount > accountMinted` condition. This allows users to bypass the intended mint limit and potentially mint more tokens than intended."

This lack of validation can lead to an exception when the `_awardExternalErc721s` function attempts to transfer an invalid or previously transferred token, thereby blocking the award phase.\n\nWhen the `_awardExternalErc721s` function is called, it iterates through the list of external ERC721 tokens and their corresponding token IDs.

14,There is no vulnerability in this codeblock.,"The vulnerability in Rocket Pool's unstaking mechanism allows for the possibility of failed unstaking transactions when the rEth contract and deposit pool are depleted. This occurs when users attempt to unstake their Ethereum (ETH) using Rocket Pool, as the protocol relies on these pools to source ETH for unstaking. If the pools are empty, Rocket Pool is unable to satisfy the unstake request, resulting in the transaction reverting.\n\nIn the event that the rEth contract and deposit pool are exhausted, users may encounter an ""Insufficient ETH balance for exchange"" error when attempting to unstake their ETH. This is because Rocket Pool's ability to unstake ETH is directly tied to the availability of ETH in these pools. When the pools are empty, Rocket Pool is unable to fulfill unstake requests, leading to failed transactions.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of monitoring the rEth contract and deposit pool's ETH balances to ensure that they remain sufficient to meet unstaking demands."

Specifically, the function takes in two amounts of tokens and a `fenwick` value, and adds them to the pool's quote tokens. However, the function does not properly check if the `fenwick` value is valid, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the pool's quote tokens.\n\nTo take advantage of the vulnerability, an attacker could manipulate the `fenwick` value to add an excessive amount of tokens to the pool, potentially draining liquidity from the pool and causing losses for other users.","The vulnerability lies in the `_auctionPrice()` function of the `Auctions.sol` contract, which calculates the price of auctioned assets for the taker. This function does not consider the floor price of the pool, which can lead to a situation where the pool becomes insolvent. \n\nWhen a borrower cannot pay their debt in an ERC20 pool, their position is liquidated, and their assets enter an auction for other users to purchase. The `_auctionPrice()` function calculates the auction price based on the current market price of the token, without considering the floor price of the pool. This can lead to a situation where the auction price falls below the floor price, allowing users to purchase tokens at a fraction of their original value. \n\nIn the proof of concept, a user decides to short a coin through a loan and refuses to take the loss to retain the value of their position. When the auction is kicked off using the `kick()` function, the price for purchasing these assets becomes increasingly cheaper as time moves forward. This can lead to a state where the pool cannot cover the debt of the user who has not paid their loan back with interest."

This can lead to a significant loss of funds for the contract.","The protocol's ability to handle multiple vaults is compromised due to an issue with the rebalancing mechanism. Specifically, the protocol's reliance on the `lastTimeStamp` variable to determine whether a rebalance is needed can lead to incorrect behavior when multiple vaults are involved.\n\nWhen the protocol is initialized with multiple vaults, such as USDC, USDT, and DAI, the `pushAllocationsToController()` function is invoked for each vault. However, the `rebalanceNeeded()` function, which is called by `pushAllocationsToController()`, uses the `lastTimeStamp` variable to determine whether a rebalance is necessary. This variable is updated to the current `block.timestamp` value when the first vault's `pushAllocationsToController()` is invoked.\n\nSubsequent invocations of `pushAllocationsToController()` for other vaults, such as DAI, will fail to rebalance due to the `require(rebalanceNeeded(), ""No rebalance needed"");` statement. This is because the `rebalanceNeeded()` function will return `false` since the `lastTimeStamp` value has not changed since the previous rebalance.\n\nAs a result, the protocol can only perform one rebalance every `rebalanceInterval` when dealing with multiple vaults, which may lead to incorrect allocation and potential security risks."

However, the function does not check for the existence of a pending transaction before updating the `rebalancingTargetData` and `oracleData` variables.

This stale data is obtained from the `PrimeCashExchangeRate.getPrimeCashFactors()` function, which returns a snapshot of the factors at a previous point in time. This can lead to inaccurate calculations of the `targetAmount`, ultimately causing the `checkRebalance()` method to incorrectly determine which currencies need to be rebalanced.\n\nThe correct approach would be to use the latest factors, which can be obtained by calling `PrimeCashExchangeRate.getPrimeCashRateView()`.

21,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"This vulnerability occurs when a fee-on-transfer token is used as collateral for a loan. In this scenario, the actual amount of collateral recorded in the contract is greater than the actual amount received by the borrower. When the borrower attempts to repay the loan, the amount of collateral withdrawn is insufficient, causing the transaction to revert.\n\nThe issue arises from the way the collateral is deposited and withdrawn. When the borrower provides collateral, the `_deposit` function in the `CollateralManager` contract transfers the collateral from the borrower's address to the `CollateralEscrowV1` contract, deducting fees twice. The first deduction occurs when the collateral is transferred from the borrower's address to the `CollateralManager` contract, and the second deduction occurs when the collateral is transferred from the `CollateralManager` contract to the `CollateralEscrowV1` contract.\n\nThe `CollateralEscrowV1` contract records the collateral balance as the original amount submitted by the borrower, without considering the fees deducted during the transfer process. When the borrower attempts to withdraw the collateral, the `_withdrawCollateral` function in the `CollateralEscrowV1` contract attempts to transfer the recorded balance to the borrower's address. However, since the actual balance in the contract is less than the recorded balance due to the fees deducted during the deposit process, the transaction reverts.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the collateral type to a fee-on-transfer token, ensuring that the actual amount of collateral recorded in the contract is greater than the actual amount received by the borrower."
22,"Vulnerability description:\nThe vulnerability lies in the constructor of the contract. It sets the `chainId` variable to a value passed in as an argument. This means that the contract is vulnerable to chain-id replay attacks.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could create a malicious contract that has the same constructor parameters as the target contract, and then call the constructor of the malicious contract from another contract. This would cause the malicious contract to set the `chainId` to the same value as the target contract, allowing the attacker to replay malicious transactions that were previously executed on the target contract.\n\nVulnerability description:\nThe vulnerability lies in the use of the `FulfillInterpreter` constructor. It accepts an `address` parameter, which could be used to pass in malicious code.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `FulfillInterpreter` constructor with the address of the target contract.

This value is then stored as an immutable state variable, ensuring it cannot be changed once set. While this approach may have been intended to avoid potential issues with the EVM, it inadvertently creates a problem in the event of a chain split.\n\nAfter a chain split, both contracts would continue to use the same, outdated chain ID, which can have undesirable consequences.

23,"Vulnerability: Double spend attack\n\nDescription:\nThe vulnerability in this code is that it allows for a double spend attack. The function `transferFrom` first transfers the specified amount of tokens from the sender's address to the recipient's address, and then it approves the sender to spend an amount equal to the transferred amount from the sender's address.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `transferFrom` function twice in quick succession. In the first call, the attacker will send the tokens to themselves, and in the second call, they will send the tokens to a different address. Since the approval is set to the transferred amount, the attacker will be able to spend the tokens from the sender's address, even though they have already transferred them to themselves.\n\nSolution:\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the approval should be set to the remaining balance of the sender's address after the transfer, rather than the transferred amount. This way, the attacker will not be able to spend the tokens from the sender's address, as they will not have enough remaining balance.",

This approach is problematic because it does not account for the compatibility issues that may arise when dealing with a large number of non-standard ERC20 tokens, such as BNB. As a result, it is likely that tokens from these unsupported tokens will be unrecoverable.\n\nThe function's logic checks for a specific set of tokens (quoteAsset, baseAsset, and WETH) and reverts the transaction if an unsupported token is detected. However, this approach is limited and may not cover all possible ERC20 tokens, including popular ones like BNB."
27,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"When a user submits the initial batch of compressed block data after migrating to an updated contract, the finalization process fails. This occurs in the `_finalizeCompressedBlocks` function, where the `startingDataParentHash` variable is unexpectedly empty. As a result, the `startingParentFinalStateRootHash` variable also becomes empty. The subsequent check `_finalizationData.parentStateRootHash == stateRootHashes[currentL2BlockNumber]` requires a match between `_finalizationData.parentStateRootHash` and `_initialStateRootHash`, which is not empty. Consequently, the condition `startingParentFinalStateRootHash!= _finalizationData.parentStateRootHash` evaluates to true, triggering a revert with the error ""FinalStateRootHashDoesNotMatch"".\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that the `startingDataParentHash` variable is not properly initialized, leading to an incorrect comparison with `_finalizationData.dataParentHash`. This, in turn, causes the subsequent checks to fail, resulting in a revert. The code snippet responsible for this behavior is as follows:\n```\nif (stateRootHashes[currentL2BlockNumber]!= `_finalizationData.parentStateRootHash`) {\n    revert StartingRootHashDoesNotMatch();\n}\n```\nThe code attempts to compare the `stateRootHashes[currentL2BlockNumber]` with `_finalizationData.parentStateRootHash`, but since `startingDataParentHash` is empty, the comparison is invalid, leading to the error."
28,"Vulnerability: Unprotected function call\n\nDescription: The `recover` function calls the `call{value: amount}` method on the msg.sender, which is an address. This method allows the recipient of the call to transfer the specified amount of Ether to a contract address. However, this method is not protected by any checks or permissions, which means that any user can call this method and transfer Ether to any contract address.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call the `recover` function with a malicious contract address, which will transfer the specified amount of Ether to the attacker's contract.\n\nOutput: There ids no vulnerability.","The `recover()` function in the `SecondaryRewarder` contract, which is responsible for retrieving tokens sent to the address or excess reward tokens, may not be able to successfully recover tokens of a specific type, such as `USDT`. This is because the `IERC20.transfer()` method, used to execute the transfer, does not return a boolean value. This is a characteristic of certain tokens, like `USDT`, which do not provide a return value when executing a transfer.\n\nWhen the `recover()` function attempts to transfer a token of this type using the `IERC20.transfer()` method, the execution will always revert due to the lack of a return value. This is because the `require` statement, which checks the status of the transfer, will fail since the method does not return a boolean value."

However, the contract owner can also call the `revert` function, which would cancel the most recent call to `setBlacklist`.\n\nThe attacker could call `setBlacklist` with a `true` value, which would add the address to the blacklist. Then, immediately after, they could call `revert` to cancel the most recent call to `setBlacklist`. This would add the address to the blacklist without the contract owner's knowledge or consent.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the contract owner should be required to sign a message or use a cryptographic signature to approve the `setBlacklist` function before it can be called.

The attacker can take advantage of the vulnerability by manipulating the `maintenance` and `minMaintenance` parameters.\n\nThe `maintenance` parameter is used to calculate the maintenance fee for the market, which is the fee paid by the market maker to the market taker. The `minMaintenance` parameter is used to set the minimum maintenance fee that the market maker is willing to pay.\n\nThe code calculates the collateral before and after liquidation by adding the initial collateral and the outstanding positions, and then subtracting the liquidation fee and the maintenance fee. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the maintenance fee is less than the minimum maintenance fee.\n\nIn this case, the code will set the maintenance fee to 0, which means that the market maker will not pay any maintenance fee. However, this will cause the market to be vulnerable to a bank run, as the market takers will be able to withdraw their funds without paying any fees.\n\nTo take advantage of this vulnerability, the attacker can manipulate the `maintenance` and `minMaintenance` parameters to set the maintenance fee to 0, and then withdraw their funds from the market without paying any fees.

This can happen when a user's position is liquidated, and the liquidation fee exceeds the user's remaining collateral. In this scenario, the user's account is left with a negative balance, which can have severe consequences.\n\nWhen a user's account is liquidated, the protocol's total funds are reduced by the liquidation fee, but the user's collateral remains outstanding. In the event that the user's account is closed, the protocol may not have sufficient funds to cover the remaining collateral, leading to a shortfall. This can trigger a bank run, as users rush to withdraw their funds before the protocol's funds are depleted.\n\nIn the provided test scenario, the user's account is liquidated, leaving a negative collateral balance of $100. The protocol's total funds are reduced by the liquidation fee, and the remaining users, User1 and User2, have a total collateral balance of $1100. However, the protocol only has $1000 in funds available for withdrawal, resulting in a shortfall of $100 for User2. This scenario demonstrates how the ""bad debt"" liquidation can lead to a bank run, as users rush to withdraw their funds before the protocol's funds are depleted."

If the balance is not zero, the function will revert with the error message ""bAsset vault must be empty"".\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the balance of the bAsset vault before the transfer function is called. The attacker can do this by depositing bAsset into the vault or by withdrawing bAsset from the vault. By doing so, the balance of the vault will not be zero, and the function will not revert.

Although the function checks if the vault balance is zero before removal, this validation is insufficient due to the asynchronous nature of interest collection.\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that the vault balance is not always up-to-date, as interest is collected at a 30-minute interval. This means that even if the vault balance appears to be zero, the lending pool balance may still be higher due to interest accumulation during the previous interest collection period.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a user swaps out an asset 29 minutes after the last interest collection, reducing the vault balance from 100 USD to 0. However, during those 29 minutes, the asset was still collecting interest, according to the lending pool, resulting in a higher balance. If the governor subsequently removes the asset, the interest accumulated during this period would remain stuck in the vault, effectively leaving tokens behind."
32,There is no vulnerability in this codeblock.,"The vulnerability arises from an incorrect calculation of the `borrowingCollateral` variable, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for positions within the current tick range. The calculation, `borrowingCollateral = cache.borrowedAmount - cache.holdTokenBalance`, is susceptible to underflow.\n\nThe `cache.borrowedAmount` represents the calculated amount of holdTokens based on the liquidity of a position. Meanwhile, `cache.holdTokenBalance` is the balance of holdTokens obtained after liquidity extraction and token transfers to the `LiquidityBorrowingManager`. When saleTokens are transferred, they are swapped for holdTokens and added to `cache.holdTokenBalance`. This scenario is particularly relevant when the liquidity of a position falls within the current tick range.\n\nIn such cases, both tokens are transferred to the contract, and saleTokens are swapped for holdTokens, which are then added to `cache.holdTokenBalance`. This results in `cache.holdTokenBalance` exceeding `cache.borrowedAmount`, since `cache.holdTokenBalance` equals `cache.borrowedAmount` plus the amount of saleTokens swapped. This discrepancy can cause the transaction to revert due to underflow, effectively denying service to the affected positions within the current tick range."

This could cause an overflow and result in unexpected behavior or loss of funds.","The `RocketMinipoolBase` contract's `delegateUpgrade` and `delegateRollback` functions provide the minipool owner with the ability to switch between different delegate implementations. Although this feature allows for the potential rollback of malfunctioning upgrades, it also enables the owner to rapidly switch between old and new code, potentially allowing for the sandwiching of user calls to the minipool. This can have unintended consequences, as demonstrated by the `slash` function.\n\nThe `slash` function, which is part of the latest minipool delegate implementation, is responsible for slashing the node operator's RPL balance if a slashing event has been recorded on their validator. To mark the minipool as having been slashed, the `slashed` contract variable is set to `true`.

However, the loop will never terminate because the condition ""gasleft() > _amountToLeave"" will always be true, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the ""gas"" function with a large _amountToLeave value. This will cause the infinite loop to consume all the gas in the contract's gas supply, effectively draining the contract's funds.\n\nOutput: There ids no vulnerability","The CrossDomainMessenger vulnerability is a critical issue that can result in the permanent loss of user funds. The problem arises when the `OptimismPortal` successfully ensures that the called function will not revert, but does not guarantee any remaining buffer for continued execution on the calling contract. This can lead to situations where the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` is called with an amount of gas that is sufficient to finalize the transaction, but not enough to mark the transaction as successful or failed.\n\nWhen a user performs a withdrawal using the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, they specify a `gasLimit` value, which determines the amount of gas required for the function to execute on L1. The `OptimismPortal` sends a minimum of `baseGas` to the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, which accounts for the additional overhead used by the Cross Domain Messenger. The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` then sends at least `_minGasLimit` to the target contract.\n\nThe core issue is that if the `OptimismPortal` retains sufficient gas after its call to complete the transaction, and the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` runs out of gas after its transaction is complete (even if the tx succeeded), the result is that the transaction is marked as finalized in the Portal, while the Cross Domain Messenger transaction reverts, causing the target transaction to revert and not set it in `failedMessages`. This can lead to the permanent loss of user funds.\n\nThe vulnerability can occur in situations where the user sets a gas limit that is too low for a transaction, or when the target contract uses more gas than the minimum required. In these cases, the user may think that their transaction is replayable and gas limits don't need to be set precisely, but they can actually lose their entire withdrawal."

This means that if the `getParentAndBlockhash` function fails, the `reCalculateBlockheaders` function will not be able to calculate the correct parent and blockhash, and it will return `0x0` instead.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `getParentAndBlockhash` function with a bad input, such as a block header that does not exist, or a block header with an invalid parent. This will cause the `getParentAndBlockhash` function to fail, and the `reCalculateBlockheaders` function to return `0x0`. The attacker can then call the `addBlockhash` function with a valid block header and a calculated hash of `0x0`, which will add a new block to the blockchain with a calculated hash of `0x0`.

Specifically, if `_blockheaders` is empty, the method will unnecessarily store the same value that is already present in the `blockhashMapping` at the same location and emit a `LogBlockhashAdded` event, indicating that a blockhash has been added, even though no changes have been made.\n\nThis vulnerability arises from the fact that the `recreateBlockheaders` method does not check if `_blockheaders` contains any elements before attempting to recalculate the blockhashes. As a result, the method will simply return the `currentBlockhash` without performing any actual calculations, and the `blockhashMapping` will remain unchanged. The `LogBlockhashAdded` event will still be emitted, indicating that a blockhash has been added, even though no changes have been made.\n\nIn the provided code, the `recreateBlockheaders` method is called with an empty `_blockheaders` array, which causes the method to return the `currentBlockhash` without performing any calculations.

The function loops through the `openLiens` array, making payments to each lien in sequence. However, the `_deleteLienPosition` function, which is called when a lien is fully paid off, actively compresses the lien stack by shifting all liens above the paid-off lien down and removing the top element.\n\nThis compression has a significant impact on the array indices, causing the `_makePayment` function to access an out-of-bounds (OOB) index when attempting to make a payment to the next lien. This is because the paid-off lien's index is replaced by the next lien, effectively moving the entire array down by one position.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where there are two liens on a collateral, with `liens[0].amount` equal to 100 and `liens[1].amount` equal to 50. When a user attempts to pay off their entire lien balance, the `_makePayment` function will first pay off `liens[0]` and then attempt to pay off `liens[1]`. However, after `_deleteLienPosition` is called to remove `liens[0]`, the array is compressed, and `liens[1]` moves into the `liens[0]` position. When the `_makePayment` function attempts to access the data for the lien at index 1, it will fail due to an OOB error because the array no longer contains an index of 1."
44,"Vulnerability description:\n\n1. The first codeblock is a Solidity modifier that checks if the contract has been initialised before allowing access to certain functions.

The attacker can then call the function again with a different new address, effectively double-spending the staked tokens.\n\nFor example, an attacker could call the function with the following parameters:\n```\nsetValidatorAddress(1, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001); // Validator ID 1\nsetValidatorAddress(1, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002); // New address 1\n```\nIn this case, the attacker would effectively double-spend the staked tokens, as the `shares` and `staked` fields of the new address would be updated, but the old address would still have the staked tokens.\n\nSolution:\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the `setValidatorAddress` function should check if the new address already has some staked tokens before updating the `shares` and `staked` fields. This can be done by checking if the new address has any balance in the staking contract.","The `setValidatorAddress` function in the smart contract allows a validator to migrate to a new address, stacking their existing stake onto the new address without checking the `validatorMaxStake` threshold. This vulnerability enables a validator to bypass the intended limit on their stake, potentially leading to an unfair advantage in earning rewards.\n\nWhen a validator migrates to a new address using `setValidatorAddress`, the function simply adds their existing stake to the new address without verifying whether the combined total exceeds the maximum allowed stake. This allows a validator to accumulate an excessive amount of stake, which can be exploited to earn an unfair share of rewards.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a validator, Bob, has a self-stake equal to `validatorMaxStake`. Bob then creates another address, B2, and delegates some stake to his validator. By migrating to B2 using `setValidatorAddress`, Bob's stake is stacked on top of B2's existing stake, exceeding the `validatorMaxStake` threshold. Bob can then repeat this process with subsequent addresses, B3, B4, and so on, allowing him to accumulate an excessive amount of stake.\n\nFurthermore, even if the contract administrator attempts to freeze Bob's account, he can exploit the unstake mechanism to withdraw his stake before the freeze takes effect.

48,"Vulnerability: Potential for re-entrancy attack\n\nDescription:\n\nIn the Solidity code, there is a function called ""delegatecall"" which allows the contract to execute another contract's code as if it was the calling contract. This function can be exploited by an attacker to perform a re-entrancy attack.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can create a ZeroExTransaction with a high gasPrice and a long expirationTimeSeconds. The transaction will be executed by the contract, and the attacker's contract will delegatecall the ZeroExTransaction's data. If the ZeroExTransaction's data contains a function that modifies the contract's state, the attacker's contract will be able to execute that function again, causing a re-entrancy attack.\n\nFor example, if the ZeroExTransaction's data contains a function that transfers tokens from the contract's address, the attacker's contract will be able to execute that function again, causing the tokens to be transferred again, and again, and so on, until the contract's balance is depleted.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo prevent re-entrancy attacks, the contract should use a ""safe"" function that does not allow the contract to be re-entered. One way to do this is to use the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern, which involves separating the contract's state changes from its interactions with the outside world. Another way is to use the ""delegatecall"" function with the ""gas"" argument set to a high value, which will prevent the attacker's contract from being able to execute the ZeroExTransaction's data again.","The vulnerability lies in the implementation of ZeroExTransactions, a type of meta transaction supported by the Exchange. Specifically, the gas limit of these transactions is not strictly enforced, allowing relayers to manipulate the outcome of the transaction by choosing a low gas limit.

This allows the attacker's transaction to succeed, while the original ZeroExTransaction is rendered invalid and cannot be replayed. The signer must then produce a new signature and try again, potentially leading to an infinite loop of failed attempts.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that ZeroExTransactions do not require a specific gas limit, allowing relayers to choose the gas limit arbitrarily.

This means that if the denominator is divisible by 1e18, the result of the division will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, which can result in incorrect calculations of quoteAmount and newPrice.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the input values of baseAmount, state.price, and decs.quoteDec in a way that causes the denominator to be divisible by 1e18. This would result in the division operation being rounded down to the nearest whole number, leading to incorrect calculations of quoteAmount and newPrice.

This contract can then call the `Cooler.clearRequest()` function with the `_isCoolerCallback` parameter set to `true`, effectively bypassing the check and allowing the malicious lender to execute the logic without implementing the `CoolerCallback` abstract.\n\nFurthermore, this vulnerability can also be exploited through the loan ownership transfer mechanism. A lender can approve the transfer of loan ownership to a contract that doesn't implement the `CoolerCallback` abstract, but still sets the `loan.callback` flag to `true`.

In the first call, the attacker will approve the transfer of the token from their address to a different address. In the second call, the attacker will call the `approveAndCall` function again, but this time they will set the `_spender` address to the address they approved in the first call. This will cause the `approveAndCall` function to call the `receiveApproval` function of the `tokenRecipient` struct, which will update the approval status of the attacker's address to the second address they approved.\n\nAs a result, the attacker will be able to transfer the token from the current owner to the second address they approved, without the current owner's knowledge or consent. The current owner will not receive any tokens as a result of this transaction, as the `receiveApproval` function will only update the approval status of the `_spender` address, not the current owner's address.","The `approveAndCall` function in the provided smart contract is vulnerable to an unused return parameter, specifically the `bool success` variable.

By calling the `test_any_non_owner_can_see_password` function, an attacker can simulate the Victim's address and read the Victim's password from the contract's storage. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who wants to steal the Victim's password or use it for malicious purposes.","The vulnerability lies in the assumption that the `s_password` state variable, marked as `private` in the `PasswordStore` contract, is a secret and can only be accessed by the owner. However, this assumption is flawed as the data on the blockchain is inherently transparent and can be viewed by anyone. In Solidity, the `private` keyword only provides encapsulation and access control within the contract itself, but does not offer complete data privacy on the public blockchain.\n\nThe `s_password` variable is stored in a storage slot, which can be accessed by anyone who knows its location. This means that any malicious actor on the network can read the owner's password by accessing the storage slot and converting the `bytes` data to a `string`.

However, the `_isDeviating` function calculates the deviation incorrectly. Specifically, it multiplies the deviation by the maximum value and divides by the smaller value, which could lead to incorrect results if the values are not properly aligned. For example, if the maximum deviation is 0.01 and the smaller value is 100, the calculation would be ((100 - 100) * 0.01) / 100, which is always 0. This means that the contract will always return true for any deviation, which is incorrect.\n\nIn the `UniswapV3_PriceMismatch` function, the contract uses the `isDeviatingWithBpsCheck` function to check if the deviation between the base price and the TWAP is within a certain range. If it is not, the contract reverts with an error message. However, since the `_isDeviating` function is incorrect, the contract will always revert with an error message, which could lead to a loss of funds for the contract.","The `isDeviatingWithBpsCheck` function in the codebase is responsible for verifying whether the deviation between two values exceeds a defined threshold. However, the current implementation is flawed, as it calculates the deviation from the larger value to the smaller one, rather than from the mean (or TWAP). This incorrect calculation allows deviations beyond the specified limits, potentially compromising the accuracy of the price checks.\n\nThe function is typically used to ensure that the current value does not deviate excessively from the TWAP value, as seen in the example provided. In the UniswapV3 contract, this function is used to check if the spot price deviates significantly from the TWAP price. However, due to the incorrect deviation calculation, the function allows deviations that exceed the acceptable threshold.\n\nFor instance, in the given example, the TWAP price is 1000, and the allowed deviation is 10%. The correct deviation calculation would consider the deviation from the mean, resulting in an allowed price range of 900 to 1100. However, the current implementation allows a price range of 900 to 1111, as the deviation calculation is based on the absolute difference between the larger and smaller values, rather than the mean. This incorrect calculation permits deviations that exceed the specified threshold, compromising the accuracy of the price checks."

The `MagnetarCollateralModule::depositAddCollateralAndBorrowFromMarket` function is then called, which deposits collateral and borrows from the Market contract. The `_extractTokens` function is executed, transferring the collateral to the Magnetar contract. However, the Magnetar contract has not set the necessary approval for the Market contract through the Pearlmit contract, leading to a revert when the `pearlmit.transferFromERC1155` function is called.\n\nThis issue is not unique to the `TOFTMarketReceiverModule::marketBorrowReceiver` flow, as similar issues are present in other occurrences, such as `TOFT::mintLendXChainSGLXChainLockAndParticipateReceiver` and `TOFT::lockAndParticipateReceiver`. In these cases, the `_addTokens` function expects an allowance through the Pearlmit contract, which is not set, resulting in a revert.\n\nThe `_setApprovalForYieldBox` function is called, but it only sets the allowance for the YieldBox contract, not the Market contract.

This means that when an old policy expires, the `totalCoverTokens` value remains unchanged, and users waiting to withdraw liquidity are forced to wait for someone to purchase a new policy to update this value.\n\nIn essence, the `totalCoverTokens` variable is not updated in a timely manner, leading to potential issues with liquidity withdrawal and policy management."

The issue arises from the fact that the `addWithdrawRequest` function only checks the user's token balance at the time of request submission, without considering any subsequent changes to the user's token holdings.\n\nWhen a user requests a withdrawal, the function checks if the requested amount is within the user's available balance. However, this check is performed without considering the possibility that the user may move their tokens to another wallet after submitting the request. This allows an attacker to request a small withdrawal amount, move their tokens to another wallet, and then prevent the settlement process from occurring by reverting the burn operation.\n\nThe attacker can repeatedly request small withdrawal amounts in each epoch, effectively freezing the settlement process and preventing other users from withdrawing their funds.

65,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The `totalBPTSupply` calculation in the `Boosted3TokenAuraVault` contract is flawed, as it uses `totalSupply` instead of `virtualSupply` to determine the amount of BPT supply in circulation. This leads to an excessive inflation of the `totalBPTSupply` value, causing the `emergencyBPTWithdrawThreshold` to be set unrealistically high.\n\nIn the `getEmergencySettlementBPTAmount` function, the `totalBPTSupply` is derived from the `totalSupply` of the pool, which is not the correct metric to use. The `virtualSupply` should be used to accurately calculate the BPT supply in circulation. This incorrect calculation results in an inflated `totalBPTSupply` value, which in turn sets the `emergencyBPTWithdrawThreshold` to an unrealistically high value.\n\nAs a result, the condition at Line 97 in the `SettlementUtils` contract will always evaluate to `true`, causing the function to revert.

The function first checks if the caller is authorized by checking if the address is in the `_whitelist` mapping. If the address is in the whitelist, the function proceeds to add the auctioneer to the whitelist and returns.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `registerAuctioneer` function with an auctioneer address that is not in the whitelist. The function will revert with an error message, but the attacker can then call the function again with the same auctioneer address, effectively adding the auctioneer to the whitelist. The attacker can then call the `registerAuctioneer` function again with a different auctioneer address, and the function will add the new auctioneer to the whitelist, bypassing the original reversion. This allows the attacker to add multiple auctioneers to the whitelist without any restrictions.\n\nSolution: To fix this vulnerability, the function should check if the auctioneer is already in the whitelist before adding it. This can be done by checking if the `auctioneers` array contains the auctioneer address.","The Auctioneer Cannot Be Removed From The Protocol vulnerability arises when an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerable Auctioneer, and there is no mechanism to remove the compromised Auctioneer from the protocol.

By utilizing a delegate call to a corresponding malicious contract, the colluding group can bypass the requirement that an owner can only be replaced if they no longer wear their signer hat.\n\nIn the `_swapSigner` function, a loop iterates through the `_owners` array, checking each owner's validity using the `isValidSigner` function. However, this check does not account for the possibility of a change of owners, allowing the malicious group to manipulate the ownership structure and replace signers without being detected."
69,"There is a vulnerability in the code. The vulnerability is in the `getStablePoolTokenPrice` function, which calculates the pool value using the `mulDiv` function.

If an attacker provides an `outputDecimals_` value outside of this range, the function will throw an error, which could be exploited to manipulate the pool value.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by providing an `outputDecimals_` value outside of the valid range, causing the function to throw an error and potentially manipulate the pool value.","The vulnerability is related to the incorrect calculation of the StablePool BPT price. The current implementation does not consider the rates provided by the `rateProviders` when calculating the minimum price of the pool tokens. This can lead to inaccurate BPT prices and TVL calculations.\n\nThe correct calculation involves considering the rates provided by the `rateProviders` when calculating the minimum price of the pool tokens. This is achieved by dividing the market price of each constituent token by the rate provided by the `rateProviders`. The minimum price is then calculated as the minimum of the rates-adjusted market prices.\n\nThe current implementation, however, does not perform this adjustment, which can result in incorrect BPT prices and TVL calculations. For example, in the provided example, the calculated TVL is significantly different from the correct TVL calculated using the adjusted rates.\n\nThe correct calculation involves the following steps:\n\n1. Get market prices for each constituent token using chainlink oracles.\n2. Get the rates provided by the `rateProviders` for each constituent token.\n3. Adjust the market prices by dividing them by the rates provided by the `rateProviders`.\n4. Calculate the minimum price as the minimum of the adjusted market prices.\n5.

70,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblock.,"The withdrawal delay mechanism is designed to prevent protection sellers from withdrawing funds immediately when a protected lending pool defaults. However, this mechanism can be bypassed by creating a withdrawal request in each cycle, allowing the user to withdraw their funds in each cycle's open state. This is achieved by repeatedly requesting withdrawals in each cycle, effectively canceling out the delay mechanism.\n\nThe `_requestWithdrawal()` function, responsible for processing withdrawal requests, does not keep track of the user's current withdrawal requests. Instead, it allows users to request withdrawals for their entire balance in each cycle, effectively setting the `withdrawalCycleDetails[Each Cycle][User]` to the user's sToken balance. This enables users to withdraw their funds at the end of the current cycle, rather than waiting until the next cycle, as intended.\n\nThis vulnerability allows users to circumvent the withdrawal delay mechanism, potentially leading to unintended consequences, such as the loss of funds for the lending pool."
71,There is no vulnerability in this code.,"The vulnerability lies in the assumption made about the peg of USDC, which can lead to manipulations in the system. Specifically, the price of USDC is used as a reference point for other tokens in the pool, as well as for evaluating the USD price of a Synthetix collateral. This assumption is made in the `DepositReceipt_USDC.sol` contract at lines 87 and 110, where the USDC price is compared to its USD price from a Chainlink oracle.\n\nFurthermore, the `Vault_Synths.sol` contract at line 76 also relies on a hard-coded peg of sUSD, assuming it is pegged at $1. The `priceCollateralToUSD` function uses this assumption to calculate the value of a synth in sUSD.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated by the lack of a stability mechanism for isoUSD, which means that the price of isoUSD can be manipulated by exploiting the hard peg assumptions. This can create arbitrage opportunities, as the price of sUSD and USDC may differ on exchanges and on Isomorph."

This would cause the contract to continuously remove liquidity from the pool, effectively draining it of its tokens.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `remove_liquidity_one_coin` function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it modifies the state of the contract (e.g., by reducing the amount of tokens in the pool) without first ensuring that all outgoing transactions have been executed. This means that if an attacker calls the function multiple times, they can manipulate the order of the transactions to their advantage, causing the contract to behave in a way that is not intended by the developer.","The ConvexSpell#closePositionFarm function in the ConvexSpell smart contract is vulnerable to liquidity removal without slippage protection, making it susceptible to sandwich attacks. This vulnerability arises from the removal of liquidity as a single token, as seen in lines `ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin(amountPosRemove, int128(tokenIndex), 0);`, which allows an attacker to withdraw liquidity and then immediately re-provide it at a higher price, effectively stealing the difference.\n\nThis issue is particularly concerning for smaller pairs, where the liquidity is already limited, making it easier for an attacker to manipulate the market. The lack of slippage protection in the `remove_liquidity_one_coin` function leaves the contract open to this type of attack."
78,"Vulnerability: The code does not properly check the returned values of the `getAmountOut` function.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can manipulate the return values of the `getAmountOut` function to bypass the required checks and gain access to the system's resources.\n\nExplanation: The `getAmountOut` function returns two values, `amountOut` and `stablePool`. The code assumes that these values are correct and does not properly check them. An attacker can manipulate the return values of the `getAmountOut` function to bypass the required checks and gain access to the system's resources. For example, an attacker can return a value for `stablePool` that is not `stable` and cause the code to execute the `require` statement without triggering the error message. This would allow the attacker to manipulate the system's behavior and gain access to its resources.","The vulnerability allows a malicious user to evade liquidation by manipulating the pricing of the opposite pool in the Velodrome router. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the `priceLiquidity` function in the `DepositReceipt` contract reverts if the router routes through the wrong pool (i.e., the volatile pool instead of the stable pool) when estimating the `amountOut`.\n\nWhen a user interacts with the `Vault_Velo` contract, it attempts to price the liquidity of the user by calling the `priceLiquidity` function in the corresponding `DepositReceipt` contract. This function uses the Velodrome router to estimate the `amountOut` by swapping the underlying assets. The router can have both a stable and volatile pool for each asset pair, and it routes through the pool that provides the best price.\n\nA malicious user can manipulate the price of the opposite pool to ensure that the router routes through the wrong pool, causing the transaction to revert. This allows the malicious user to avoid being liquidated, as the liquidation call would be reverted due to the incorrect pool being used. The malicious user can repeatedly manipulate the price of the opposite pool to maintain this advantage, effectively DOSing the pool and avoiding liquidation.\n\nThe vulnerable code snippet, which is responsible for estimating the `amountOut`, is as follows:\n```\nuint256 amountOut; //amount received by trade\nbool stablePool; //if the traded pool is stable or volatile.\n(amountOut, stablePool) = router.getAmountOut(HUNDRED_TOKENS, token1, USDC);\nrequire(stablePool == stable, ""pricing occuring through wrong pool"" );\n```\nIn this code, the `require` statement checks that the `stablePool` variable matches the expected value.

The attacker could then call the `accept` function with the same sale, which would check if the secret matches the secretHash value for secretD, and since the secret provided in the `provideSecret` function did not match any secretHash value, the `accept` function would not revert, allowing the attacker to accept the sale.","The vulnerability arises from a design flaw in the `provideSecret` function, which allows an attacker, in this case, Dave, to intentionally reuse a secret hash that has already been used by either the borrower (Alice) or the lender (Bob).

The `_sellfCash` function is executed, which relies on the `getPrincipalFromfCashBorrow` view function to calculate the prime cash to be withdrawn for a given fCash amount.\n\nThe `getPrincipalFromfCashBorrow` function uses spot data, including the spot interest rate, spot utilization, and spot total supply/total debt, to compute the prime cash to be withdrawn. This spot data is used to determine the interest rate used for discounting the fCash amount. By manipulating the spot data, specifically the utilization rate, Bob can influence the interest rate used for discounting, resulting in a higher cash value being returned.\n\nTo achieve this manipulation, Bob can deposit prime cash into the market, reducing the utilization rate and causing the interest rate to decrease. This decrease in interest rate results in a higher cash value being returned, allowing Bob to receive more cash than expected. The gain for Bob is equivalent to the protocol loss, as the manipulation is a zero-sum game.\n\nThis vulnerability allows malicious users to exploit the system by manipulating the spot data, resulting in an unfair advantage and a loss for the protocol."

When the contract calls the StakeUtils.iceBearStake function, it would cause the codeblock to enter an infinite loop, effectively freezing the contract and preventing it from executing any further code.\n\nOutput: There is no vulnerability.","The Geode team introduced a mechanism to prevent node operators from proposing an excessive number of validators, known as the `MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD`. This threshold is checked during the `proposeStake` call, which is initiated by the node operator to propose new validators. The onboarding process involves two steps: a proposal from the node operator and approval from the planet maintainer. After the first step, proposed validators are assigned a status of `proposed`, and after the second step, they are marked as `active` and their Ethereum accounting is processed.\n\nHowever, a critical issue was discovered in the `proposed` validators step, where the `MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD` check does not account for previously proposed but not yet active validators. This allows a node operator to propose multiple validators, pass the initial `MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD` check, and then propose additional validators in a separate transaction, without being detected. The lack of a monopoly check during the `beaconStake` or maintainer approval step further enables the activation of an excessive number of validators, potentially leading to a monopoly.\n\nFor instance, if `MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD` is set to 5, a node operator could propose 4 new validators, pass the initial check, and label them as `proposed`. They could then propose 4 more validators in a separate transaction, as the `MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD` check does not account for the previously proposed but not yet active validators. Subsequently, during the `beaconStake` or maintainer approval step, there is no monopoly check, allowing 8 validators to be activated simultaneously."
110,"Vulnerability: Use of `require` without `revert`\n\nDescription:\nThe codeblock contains a `require` statement without a `revert` statement.

The `isContract` function checks if the contract is an address and not an EOA (Externally Owned Account).

The attacker can then call the `updateController` function with a contract that is an EOA, and the contract will continue executing without throwing an error or a warning.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `require` statement is used to ensure that the contract's state is consistent. In this case, the `require` statement checks if the input contract is a valid contract by calling the `isContract` function. If the input contract is not a valid contract, the `require` statement will throw an error or a warning, and the contract will not continue executing.\n\nHowever, the codeblock does not include a `revert` statement, which means that if the `require` statement is not executed, the contract will continue executing without throwing an error or a warning. This can be exploited by an attacker who calls the `updateController` function with a contract that is an EOA, and the contract will continue executing without throwing an error or a warning.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the codeblock should include a `revert` statement that throws an error or a warning if the `require` statement is not executed. For example:\n```\nrequire(isContract(_controller), ERROR_CONTRACT_IS_EOA);\nrevert()\n```\nThis will ensure that if the `require` statement is not executed, the contract will throw an error or a warning, and the execution will be stopped.","The `updateController` function in the `Tap` contract allows updating the `Controller` contract it is using. This functionality is currently not restricted in the `FundraisingMultisigTemplate`, which may lead to unintended consequences in custom deployments.

However, in certain scenarios, the secondary chain may not receive rewards, causing the `shouldUpdate` flag to remain false, and the `performUpkeep` function to revert.\n\nThis issue arises when a user stakes directly in the secondary chain, and the queuedRESDLSupplyChange increments. Since there are no rewards assigned to the secondary chain, the `shouldUpdate` flag remains false, and the `performUpkeep` function is reverted.

This is achieved by canceling limit swap orders submitted in a block range, which can be executed at a later point in time, allowing the attacker to observe the price movement in the intervening blocks.\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that oracle block ranges are not fixed, and the execution of limit swap orders is delayed by two blocks. This creates a window of opportunity for attackers to cancel their orders and observe the price movement in the intervening blocks. By doing so, they can gain valuable information about the future price direction, which can be used to make informed trading decisions.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where an attacker submits a large swap limit order in block range N, which is executed at the median price of block N+2. Meanwhile, market orders with swaps are submitted in block range N+2, which are executed at the median price of block N+2. By observing the price movement in block N+1, the attacker can predict with high probability whether the two orders will result in a profit or loss. If a profit is expected, the attacker can submit a market order at block N+2.

This manipulation enables the owner to receive an inflated share count during a deposit, which can then be exploited during a withdrawal.\n\nThe attack begins by the owner increasing the maximum allowed deviations using the `setDeviation` function or decreasing the TWAP interval using the `setTwapInterval` function, effectively rendering the `_onlyCalmPeriods` check ineffective. Next, the owner takes a flash loan and manipulates the `pool.slot0` value to an inflated state. This is done by using the flash loan to increase the `pool.slot0` value, which is then used to calculate the shares during a deposit.\n\nThe shares calculation is based on the `price` variable, which is derived from the manipulated `pool.slot0` value. This results in an inflated share count being allocated to the owner during the deposit. The owner then unwinds the flash loan, returning the `pool.slot0` value to its normal state. Finally, the owner withdraws the tokens, receiving a significantly larger amount than they should be able to due to the inflated share count.\n\nThis attack exploits the lack of proper validation and authorization checks in the `StrategyPassiveManagerUniswap` contract, allowing the owner to manipulate the pool's state and steal tokens from users."

However, a critical issue arises due to the lack of verification that the tokens and NFTs are actually transferred to the `govUserKeeper` contract.\n\nThe `delegateTreasury` function relies on the assumption that a successful transfer is completed, and subsequently, the voting power of the delegatee is increased.

However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a reentrancy attack.\n\nIn the next line, the function updates the account's principal and other fields, and then calls the `account.save` function to save the changes to the blockchain.\n\nAfter that, the function calls the `GetRoute.agentPolice(router).addPoolToList` function to add the agent's pool to a list.\n\nFinally, the function calls the `liquidStakingToken.mint` function to mint the receiver the shares of the account principal.\n\nThe attacker can exploit this by calling the `jumpStartAccount` function multiple times in quick succession, each time with a different `receiver` and `accountPrincipal` value.\n\nIn the first call, the attacker sends the `accountPrincipal` to the receiver. In the second call, the attacker sends a smaller amount of tokens to the receiver, and then calls the `jumpStartAccount` function again, this time with a different `receiver` and `accountPrincipal` value.\n\nThe `jumpStartAccount` function will save the changes to the blockchain, and then call the `GetRoute.agentPolice(router).addPoolToList` function to add the agent's pool to the list.\n\nHowever, before the `GetRoute.agentPolice(router).addPoolToList` function can execute, the attacker's second call to `jumpStartAccount` will execute, and the attacker will receive the remaining `accountPrincipal` value.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `jumpStartAccount` function should use a `state variable` to keep track of the current transaction state, and only allow the `liquidStakingToken.mint` function to execute after the `GetRoute.agentPolice(router).addPoolToList` function has executed.","The `jumpStartAccount` function in the `InfinityPool` contract allows an account to be initialized with a debt position in the pool, bypassing the standard approval checks typically applied to regular borrowing.

This is achieved by manipulating the `queuedRESDLSupplyChange` variable, which is used to calculate the rewards distributed to each secondary chain.\n\nThe attack begins by having an existing reSDL NFT on a secondary chain, with a boost calculated based on the original `maxBoost` value. When the `maxBoost` value is decreased, the attacker can call the `SDLPoolSecondary:extendLockDuration` function to extend the locking duration of their reSDL NFT. This triggers the `_queueLockUpdate` function, which recalculates the boost amount using the new `maxBoost` value.\n\nThe attacker can then execute the queued update, which sets the `boostAmount` to a value that is less than the original boost amount. This results in a decrease in `queuedRESDLSupplyChange`, which is then incremented by the difference between the new and original boost amounts.\n\nThe attacker can repeat this process, increasing the locking duration and recalculating the boost amount, until they have increased `queuedRESDLSupplyChange` by a significant amount. This allows them to funnel more rewards to their secondary chain, as `queuedRESDLSupplyChange` is used to calculate the rewards distributed to each secondary chain.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from the fact that the update logic allows existing reSDL NFTs to increase `queuedRESDLSupplyChange` more than should be possible after a decrease in `maxBoost`. This is due to the improper logic in the `_executeQueuedLockUpdates` function, which sets `locks[lockId].boostAmount` to 0 when `boostAmountDiff` is negative, allowing the attacker to fraudulently increase `queuedRESDLSupplyChange`."

This vulnerability arises from the way the `ERC20Gauges` contract handles gauge activation and deactivation.\n\nWhen a gauge is initially added using the `ERC20Gauges.addGauge()` function, its rewards are queued up in the `FlywheelGaugeRewards._queueRewards()` function. The `QueuedRewards` struct is updated to store the `storedCycle` value, which is set to the current cycle.\n\nHowever, when the gauge is deactivated using the `ERC20Gauges.removeGauge()` function, it is removed from the list of active gauges. As a result, the `FlywheelGaugeRewards` contract will no longer update the `QueuedRewards` struct for that gauge. The `storedCycle` value remains unchanged, reflecting the cycle in which the gauge was last processed.\n\nWhen the gauge is reactivated, it is added back to the list of active gauges, but the `storedCycle` value is no longer synchronized with the current cycle. This causes issues when the gauge is processed in the `FlywheelGaugeRewards._queueRewards()` function, as the `assert` statement checks that `queuedRewards.storedCycle` is either 0 or greater than or equal to the last cycle. Since the `storedCycle` value is no longer synchronized, the gauge will fail this assertion, effectively locking it out of queuing up for rewards.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of ensuring that gauge states are properly updated and synchronized when gauges are deactivated and reactivated."
125,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblock.,"The `mintOpenInterestDebt()` function in the Penrose contract is responsible for tracking and distributing rewards to twTap holders based on the current USDO open interest. However, the function has two critical issues that can lead to the loss of twTap rewards.\n\nFirstly, the function does not accurately track debt accrual. Instead, it relies on querying the current total borrows via `computeTotalDebt()` to determine the total USDO debt. This approach can lead to incorrect calculations, as it does not account for debt repayment prior to the reward distribution. As a result, users who repay their debt before the reward distribution will not have their debt considered for the fees, potentially resulting in lost rewards.\n\nSecondly, the function does not consider bridging of USDO between chains. When USDO is bridged from another chain to the current chain, the `usdoToken.totalSupply()` will increment, but the `totalUsdoDebt()` will not. Conversely, when USDO is bridged from the current chain to another chain, the `usdoToken.totalSupply()` will decrement, and tokens will be burnt, while `totalUsdoDebt()` will remain the same. This can lead to incorrect reward distributions, as the function will not account for the changes in the total supply and debt.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where 1000 USDO are borrowed, and 50 USDO have already been accrued as debt. The total supply is 1000, and the total debt is 1050. When `mintOpenInterestDebt()` is called, 50 USDO should be minted and distributed among twTap holders. However, if a user bridges 100 USDO from chain B, making the total supply increment to 1100, the function will not distribute rewards because `totalUsdoDebt` is less than `usdoSupply`."
126,There is no vulnerability in this code.,"The `TokenVesting` contract's `revoke` function allows the owner to cancel the vesting of tokens for a beneficiary, but only if the beneficiary has already claimed the tokens using the `MerkleTokenVesting.claimAward` function.

However, this also means that the owner must first claim the tokens on behalf of the beneficiary, which can be a gas-intensive process.\n\nThe `revoke` function checks if the award is revocable and not already revoked before proceeding. It then calculates the unreleased tokens owed to the beneficiary, updates the `released` and `revoked` states of the award, and transfers the unreleased tokens to the beneficiary. Additionally, it transfers the revoked tokens to the owner. The function emits two events, `Released` and `Revoked`, to notify interested parties of the changes.\n\nThis design creates a potential security vulnerability, as it allows the owner to manipulate the vesting process by claiming the tokens on behalf of the beneficiary, which could be used to exploit the beneficiary's delay in claiming the tokens."

If the `allowance()` function is called multiple times in quick succession, it can lead to a reentrancy attack.\n\nIn this case, the attacker can call the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function multiple times in quick succession, each time increasing the allowance for the attacker's contract.

Since the attacker has increased the allowance for the contract's address, the `transferFrom()` function will succeed, and the tokens will be transferred to the attacker's address.\n\nThe contract owner will not be able to recover the tokens because the attacker has already transferred them to their own address.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the following codeblock:\n```\nfunction safeIncreaseAllowance(address newAllowance) public {\n    IERC20(tokens[0]).safeIncreaseAllowance(ownerIn, newAllowance);\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThis codeblock does not have a reentrancy vulnerability because it only calls the `safeIncreaseAllowance` function of the `IERC20` token contract once, without calling any other functions that could trigger a reentrancy attack.","The vulnerability arises from the use of `MAX_UINT256` when setting approval for the manager or trade router to withdraw tokens from the vault. This approach is problematic because it assumes that all ERC20 tokens support allowances up to the maximum value of `uint256`, which is not the case for several popular tokens.\n\nIn reality, some ERC20 tokens, such as UNI, COMP, and others, have a limitation on the maximum allowance value, which is typically `UINT_96`. This means that when the vault attempts to set an allowance of `MAX_UINT256` for these tokens, the transaction will fail, rendering the contract incompatible with these tokens.\n\nThis issue can lead to a situation where the vault is unable to interact with these tokens, potentially causing issues with the overall functionality of the system."

The protocol relies on a Chainlink feed to obtain the price of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. However, in the event of a depeg, where the price of USDC deviates from its peg, the protocol's valuation of USDC is not adjusted accordingly.\n\nAccording to the GMX V2 documentation, when a stablecoin depegs, the contracts will pay out profits in the stablecoin based on a price of 1 USD or the current Chainlink price for the stablecoin, whichever is higher. This means that when withdrawing from a position, the value of USDC will always be valued at 1 USD or higher, regardless of the Chainlink price.\n\nThe issue arises when the `consult` function, which retrieves the current value of USDC from the Chainlink feed, is used to calculate the slippage amount for a withdrawal. The `consult` function does not account for the fact that the value of USDC will be valued at 1 USD or higher when withdrawing from a position. As a result, the calculated slippage amount will be based on the depegged value of USDC, rather than the actual value of 1 USD.\n\nThis can lead to incorrect and potentially extreme slippage amounts being calculated, resulting in a loss of funds for users. For example, if the Chainlink price of USDC is $0.4, but the actual value of USDC is $1 when withdrawing from a position, the calculated slippage amount will be based on the depegged value of $0.4, rather than the actual value of $1. This can result in a slippage amount of almost 99%, leading to a significant loss of funds for users."

On the other hand, the `withdraw` function does not perform this check, allowing users to withdraw more than the maximum allowed amount.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by a user who deposits a large amount of a specific collateral type, takes a flash loan for another collateral type, and then deposits both collaterals. By doing so, the user can borrow more than the maximum allowed amount against the deposited collaterals. For instance, in the example provided, a user deposits $30,000 WETH and takes a flash loan for $30,000 WBTC. They then deposit both and borrow 20,000 JUSD. By withdrawing all their WBTC to repay the flash loan, the user can effectively borrow 20,000 JUSD against the deposited WETH, exceeding the individual collateral borrow limit."
140,"Vulnerability: Integer overflow vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe codeblock checks if the length of a variable `b` is less than the sum of the current `index` and the length of `nestedBytesLength`. If the condition is true, it reverts the contract.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can manipulate the values of `index` and `nestedBytesLength` to cause an integer overflow in the contract. For example, if `index` is set to a large value and `nestedBytesLength` is set to a value that is less than the maximum possible value for an integer type in Solidity (2^256 - 1), the sum of the two values will exceed the maximum possible value for an integer type in Solidity. This will cause an overflow and the contract will revert, potentially resulting in the loss of funds.\n\nExample:\nLet's say the contract is using the `uint256` type for `index` and `nestedBytesLength`. If `index` is set to 2^256 - 1 and `nestedBytesLength` is set to 0, the sum of the two values will be 2^256 - 1 + 0 = 2^256 - 1, which is greater than the maximum possible value for an `uint256` type in Solidity (2^256 - 1). This will cause an overflow and the contract will revert, potentially resulting in the loss of funds.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a type that can handle large values, such as the `uint96` or `uint128` types. Additionally, the contract should use a type that can handle negative values, such as the `int96` or `int128` types, if it needs to handle negative values.","The `LibBytes` library contains several functions that are vulnerable to integer overflows, specifically `readBytesWithLength`, `readAddress`, `writeAddress`, `readBytes32`, and `writeBytes32`, as well as `readBytes4`. These functions manipulate arrays of bytes, and their implementation involves arithmetic operations on integers.\n\nThe `readBytesWithLength` function, in particular, is susceptible to an integer overflow vulnerability. This function returns a pointer to a nested `bytes` array within an existing `bytes` array at a given `index`. The length of the nested array is added to the given `index` and checked against the parent array to ensure the data in the nested array is within the bounds of the parent. However, the addition operation can overflow, allowing the bounds check to be bypassed and returning an array that points to data outside the bounds of the parent array.\n\nThe overflow occurs when the sum of the `index` and `nestedBytesLength` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the underlying integer data type. This can happen when the `index` is large and the `nestedBytesLength` is also large, causing the addition to wrap around and result in a smaller value. As a result, the bounds check is bypassed, allowing the function to return an array that points to data outside the bounds of the parent array.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited to access and manipulate data outside the intended bounds of the `bytes` array, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or other security issues."
141,"There is a vulnerability in the code. The function `updateFeePerSecond` allows the owner to set the `feePerSecond` variable, which is used to calculate the gas fee for each second. However, the function does not perform any input validation or check if the caller is actually the owner.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `updateFeePerSecond` function with a malicious value for `feePerSecond`. For example, the attacker could set `feePerSecond` to a very small value, such as 1, which would cause the contract to pay very low gas fees to miners. Alternatively, the attacker could set `feePerSecond` to a very large value, such as 1000, which would cause the contract to pay very high gas fees to miners.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have control over the contract's owner account. Once the attacker gains control of the owner account, they could call the `updateFeePerSecond` function to set the `feePerSecond` value to a malicious value.","The vulnerability arises from a critical oversight in the protocol's fee management mechanism. Specifically, the `updateFeePerSecond` function, which allows the owner to modify the `feePerSecond` variable, fails to account for accrued fees prior to the update. This oversight can lead to inaccurate fee calculations and potentially result in incorrect fee payments.\n\nWhen the `updateFeePerSecond` function is invoked, it updates the `feePerSecond` variable without triggering a `mintFee` call, which would update the `lastFeeCollected` timestamp and mint the correct amount of fees owed up until that point. This means that any outstanding fees accrued at the old rate are not taken into account, leading to an incorrect fee calculation.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a user deposits and triggers a `mintFee` call, setting the `lastFeeCollected` timestamp to the current block timestamp. Subsequently, no additional `mintFee` calls occur for a period of two hours. When the owner updates the `feePerSecond` variable, the `mintFee` function will incorrectly calculate fees using the new, higher rate, applying it to the period before the rate change. This can result in an incorrect fee payment for the user."

143,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The `cancelVesting` function is intended to cancel a vesting grant and potentially distribute unclaimed, vested funds to the user if `giveUnclaimed` is set to `true`. However, due to a bug, this functionality is compromised when the user has staked or locked funds. Specifically, the `userVesting` variable is declared as `memory` instead of `storage`, which means that changes made to it, such as setting `userVesting.locked` to `0`, are not persisted.\n\nAs a result, when `cancelVesting` is called, the user's locked funds are effectively unstaked, but the `claimable` function, which is called later, still considers these funds as locked, preventing the distribution of the unclaimed, vested funds. This means that users who have staked all their funds and call `cancelVesting` with `giveUnclaimed` set to `true` will not receive their unclaimed, vested funds, even though they are eligible for them."

146,"Vulnerability description:\n\n1. The first codeblock is vulnerable due to the use of the `revert` keyword. This keyword is used to stop the execution of the contract and return control to the caller. In this case, the `revert` keyword is used without any additional information, which means that the contract will simply fail and return control to the caller without any further error message. This can be a problem if the contract is called by a user who is not expecting the contract to fail and does not know how to handle the error.\n2. The second codeblock is vulnerable due to the use of the `uint256` type for the `minInterestBPS` variable. This type is a fixed-point type that can only represent integers between 0 and 2^255 - 1. However, the `minInterestBPS` variable is initialized with a decimal value of 0.00001. This means that the value of `minInterestBPS` will be truncated to 0 when it is used in the calculation of `minNewRate`. This can cause the comparison `newLien.rate >= minNewRate` to always return false, even if `newLien.rate` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker could exploit the first vulnerability by calling the contract with invalid input data that the contract is not prepared to handle. The attacker could also exploit the second vulnerability by calling the contract with a value for `lien.rate` that is greater than 2^255 - 1, causing the comparison `newLien.rate >= minNewRate` to always return false.","The `isValidRefinance` function in the `AstariaRouter.sol` contract contains a critical flaw in its mathematical logic, leading to incorrect validation of refinance requests. Specifically, the function checks whether the loan interest rate has increased, rather than decreased, by more than 0.5%. This means that refinances with a rate decrease of less than 0.5% will be approved, while those with a rate decrease greater than 0.5% will be rejected.\n\nThe function's implementation is flawed, as it calculates a `minNewRate` value, which should be the maximum new rate, and then checks whether the new rate is greater than or equal to this value. This is the opposite of the intended behavior, where a rate decrease of more than 0.5% should be considered an improvement. As a result, the function will incorrectly approve refinances with rate increases or decreases of less than 0.5%, and reject those with rate decreases greater than 0.5%."

However, it does not include a check to ensure that the transfer has been completed before proceeding with the rest of the code.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the contract multiple times in quick succession, each time transferring a small amount of `swapToken` to `swapTokenGraveyard` and then immediately calling the contract again. This would cause the contract to execute the rest of the code multiple times, potentially leading to an infinite loop and draining the contract's funds.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this vulnerability, the contract should include a check to ensure that the transfer to `swapTokenGraveyard` has been completed before proceeding with the rest of the code. This can be done by using a modifier that is only executed if the transfer has been completed, or by using a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library which provides functions for safe arithmetic operations.","The vulnerability occurs when the `transferFrom` call is used to burn swap tokens, and the return value of this call is intentionally ignored. This oversight can potentially allow an attacker to mint an arbitrary amount of Amp tokens, depending on the implementation of the token being used. \n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `transferFrom` method is called on the `swapToken` object, passing in `_from`, `swapTokenGraveyard`, and `amount` as arguments. However, the return value of this method is not being utilized, which could lead to unintended consequences. \n\nIt's worth noting that the severity of this issue would have been critical if the token being used was arbitrary, as it could have allowed an attacker to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens. However, the Flexa token implementation was found to revert if the amount exceeds the allowance, which mitigates the risk. Nevertheless, this vulnerability could still pose a risk if other token implementations do not have similar safeguards in place."
150,"Vulnerability: Unsafe updates to state variables\n\nDescription: The codeblock contains an unchecked block, which means that Solidity will not perform any checks for potential reentrancy attacks.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `getLiquidationBonus` function multiple times in quick succession, causing the state variables to be updated multiple times in an uncontrolled manner.\n\nAttacking vector: The attacker could call the `getLiquidationBonus` function multiple times in quick succession, causing the state variables to be updated multiple times in an uncontrolled manner.","The `getLiquidationBonus` function in the provided code exhibits an exponential scaling issue in its calculation of liquidation bonuses. Specifically, the bonus is calculated as a proportion of the borrowed amount, multiplied by the bonus percentage for the given token, and then scaled by the number of times the loan is taken out. This means that the bonus amount grows exponentially with the number of times the loan is taken out, rather than linearly.\n\nThis issue can lead to an unfair outcome for users who take out multiple loans against the same token. For instance, if a user borrows a certain amount against one lender, they will be required to pay a certain bonus amount. However, if they borrow the same amount against multiple lenders, the bonus amount will increase exponentially, resulting in an unfair and disproportionate penalty. Furthermore, this issue can be exploited by users who repeatedly take out small loans against the same token, effectively avoiding the exponential scaling of the bonus amount.\n\nThis vulnerability can have significant implications for users who rely on the liquidation bonus calculation, as it can result in unexpected and unfair fees."

This is because the sender's instructions for the transfer may not account for the updated Transceiver configuration, potentially leading to an array index out-of-bounds exception when the instructions are parsed. \n\nFor instance, if a transfer is initiated with two Transceivers, but an additional Transceiver is added before the transfer is executed, the instructions array will be declared with a length of three, corresponding to the new number of enabled Transceivers.

Specifically, it transfers the full `paymentAmount` to the lien owner, which can lead to unintended consequences.\n\nIn the first scenario, when a user intends to pay off a single lien, they can accidentally overpay by entering a `paymentAmount` greater than the amount owed. As a result, the `_payment()` function sends the entire `paymentAmount` to the lien owner, rather than only the amount owed. This can lead to an overpayment of the lien owner's account.\n\nIn the second scenario, when a user intends to pay towards multiple loans, the `_makePayment()` function iterates through open liens and calls `_payment()` for each lien. The `_payment()` function is called with the first lien, and the `paymentAmount` is set to the full amount sent to the function. This can result in the first lien holder receiving an amount that exceeds the amount they are owed, potentially causing an overpayment.\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that the `_payment()` function transfers the full `paymentAmount` to the lien owner, without considering the amount owed or the intention of the borrower.

However, this can lead to unintended consequences, as the account's debt remains outstanding, and the vault's collateral ratio is not accurately reflected.\n\nThe issue arises because the protocol checks the account's collateral ratio after the excess cash is transferred out, rather than before. This allows the account to appear healthy, even though it is not. Furthermore, the liquidation process is blocked because the account is not settled, and the `_authenticateDeleverage()` function checks if the vault has matured before allowing the liquidation to proceed.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by sophisticated vault accounts that have excess cash in one currency and significant debt holdings in the vault's other currencies.

This occurs when a user self-liquidates their secondary debt holdings in a way that makes it impossible to deleverage their vault account. The `checkMinBorrow` function will fail post-maturity, preventing the account from being settled.\n\nIn the `deleverageAccount` function, the liquidator pays down the account debt directly, and the account does not accrue any cash. Typically, it is not possible to reduce an account's debt below its minimum borrow size. However, there are two exceptions: when liquidators purchase cash from a vault account (for non-prime vault accounts) or when a vault account is being settled and `checkMinBorrow` is skipped to ensure the account can always be settled.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when a user sets up their debt and cash holdings post-settlement, such that both `accountDebtOne` and `accountDebtTwo` are non-zero and less than `vaultConfig.minAccountSecondaryBorrow`. This allows the user to have zero primary debt and `Y` secondary debt and `X` secondary cash. After settlement, cash is used to offset debt (Y - `X` < minAccountSecondaryBorrow), and due to the lack of `checkMinBorrow` in `VaultAccountAction.settleVaultAccount()`, both secondary currencies can have debt holdings below the minimum amount.\n\nWhen `deleverageAccount` is called on a prime vault account, debts are paid down directly. However, if only one secondary currency can be paid down at a time, `checkMinBorrow` will fail in `VaultSecondaryBorrow.updateAccountSecondaryDebt()` because both debts are checked.

161,There is no vulnerability in the provided codeblock.,"The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to lock the option token minter's fund by exploiting the blocklisting mechanism in certain token contracts. Specifically, when a token is deployed via the Teller contract, the contract checks that the receiver address is not the address `0`. However, a malicious option token creator can manipulate this check by setting a blocklisted address as the receiver, which is not validated by the contract.\n\nIn particular, some tokens, such as USDC and USDT, have a contract-level admin-controlled address blocklist. If an address is added to this blocklist, transfers to and from that address are forbidden. A malicious or compromised token owner can exploit this mechanism by adding the contract address to the blocklist, effectively trapping funds within the contract.\n\nThis could occur as a result of regulatory action against the contract itself, a single user of the contract (e.g., a Uniswap LP), or as part of an extortion attempt against users of the blocked contract. When a user mints an option token using a seemingly favorable strike price, they are unaware that the receiver address is actually a blocklisted address. As a result, they can never exercise their option, as the transaction would revert when attempting to transfer assets to the receiver.\n\nThe user's fund, which was used to mint the option, remains locked, effectively rendering the option worthless. This vulnerability highlights the importance of secure and transparent implementation of blocklisting mechanisms in smart contracts to prevent such attacks."
162,There is no vulnerability in the provided codeblocks.,"The vulnerability in the `TellerV2` contract's `calculateAmountDue` function affects the calculation of loan installments for irregular loan durations. Specifically, the function incorrectly determines the last payment cycle, leading to incorrect calculations.\n\nThe issue arises when the loan duration is not a multiple of the payment cycle. In such cases, the function considers the last payment cycle to be when the borrower is one payment cycle away from the end of the loan, which is not the same as the actual last payment cycle.\n\nFor example, consider a loan of 1000 taken for 2.5 payment cycles. The borrower would expect to pay 400 + 400 + 200, but the function calculates the last payment cycle incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect payment amount.\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior and potential financial losses for borrowers."

This allows the user to withdraw their locked MENTO, but their veMENTO remains unaffected. The user's delegate can still cast votes on their behalf, even though the user has withdrawn their entire locked amount.\n\nThis edge case can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the voting process, as they can withdraw their locked MENTO and continue voting on proposals without any restrictions."

178,There is no vulnerability in the provided codeblock.,"The Uniswap formula for estimating implied volatility (IV) drastically underestimates the true IV of a given asset. This is because the formula relies on the assumption of an efficient market, where rational actors can arbitrage away any discrepancies between the estimated IV and the true IV. However, in the case of Uniswap, there is no mechanism for rational actors to profit from correcting an imbalance in the estimated IV, as liquidity providers can only provide liquidity, but not short positions.\n\nThe formula, which is based on the concept of selling a straddle, a short-volatility strategy, is flawed because it does not account for the fact that Uniswap is a ""long-only"" market, where liquidity can be added, but not shorted. This lack of a correction mechanism for low IVs leads to systematically lower IVs being estimated by the formula.\n\nThe article by Lambert Guillaume provides evidence for this claim, showing that the IV derived from Uniswap fees and liquidity is often significantly lower than the historical volatilities of the asset. The table in the article demonstrates this discrepancy, with Uniswap-derived IVs being approximately 2.5 times lower than the historical volatilities.\n\nFurthermore, the formula does not account for the fact that liquidity providers suffer far more impermanent loss than fees, which means that they are incentivized to provide liquidity even when the IV is high, driving the IV down. This lack of a correction mechanism for low IVs leads to a systematic underestimation of the true IV.\n\nTo validate this claim, one can look at on-chain data, which shows that the liquidity and fee derivation from Uniswap gives far lower results than other methods. The table provided in the article and studies showing that liquidity providers suffer far more impermanent loss than fees also support this claim."

When the maturity date arrives, the lender tokens are redeemed, and the holdings are updated. Legitimate users then attempt to redeem their ERC5095 tokens for the underlying tokens. However, a malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by minting additional tokens after the maturity date, increasing the total supply, and reducing the shares of other users.\n\nFor instance, let's consider a scenario where userA deposits 100 tokens and userB deposits 200 tokens, resulting in a total supply of 300 ERC5095 tokens.

The owner is unable to recover this excess Ether due to the `MIN_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH_FOR_SCRAPE` restriction, which prevents the owner from scraping the excess Ether.\n\nThis scenario can occur in two ways: first, when the owner removes all validators and a user requests a withdrawal of 63 ETH, leaving 1 ETH idle in the EigenPod. Second, when there are 64 ETH in an operator's EigenPod, a user requests a withdrawal of 50 ETH, and the remaining 14 ETH is idle, waiting for someone to call `scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod`."
188,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe function `functionCallWithValue` makes a call to the `target` contract with a value of `value`. The function then verifies the return data and the success of the call using the `target.call` function.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `functionCallWithValue` function from a contract that is controlled by the attacker. The attacker can then call the `target` contract again using the returned data and the remaining balance of the contract. This can cause the contract to enter a loop, allowing the attacker to drain the contract's balance indefinitely.\n\nExample:\n\n1. An attacker calls `functionCallWithValue` with `target` as a contract controlled by the attacker, `data` as the address of a function in the contract, and `value` as a large number.\n2. The function makes the call to the contract and verifies the return data and the success of the call.\n3. The attacker then calls the contract again using the returned data and the remaining balance of the contract.\n4. The contract enters a loop, draining its balance and allowing the attacker to steal the funds.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this vulnerability, the function should use the `target.call.value` function instead of `target.call`.

189,"There is a vulnerability in the `_addKeysAndLoansInfo` function. The function iterates through an array of `LoanInfo` objects and checks if a borrowing key already exists in the `tokenIdLoansKeys` array for each loan's token ID. If the borrowing key does not exist, it is added to the array using the `update` flag.\n\nThe vulnerability is that the `update` flag is not checked before adding the borrowing key to the array. This means that if an attacker calls the `_addKeysAndLoansInfo` function with the `update` flag set to `false`, they can still add a borrowing key to the `tokenIdLoansKeys` array.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario:\n\n1. An attacker calls the `_addKeysAndLoansInfo` function with the `update` flag set to `false` and passes in a `borrowingKey` value.\n2. The function iterates through the `sourceLoans` array and checks if a borrowing key already exists in the `tokenIdLoansKeys` array for each loan's token ID.\n3. Since the `update` flag is not checked, the borrowing key is added to the `tokenIdLoansKeys` array for each loan's token ID.\n\nAn attacker can then use the added borrowing keys to manipulate the loans and gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\nTo fix the vulnerability, the `update` flag should be checked before adding the borrowing key to the `tokenIdLoansKeys` array.","The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the liquidity provider (LP) by packing the `tokenIdToBorrowingKeys` array with a large number of user keys.

The attacker can achieve this by repeatedly borrowing small amounts of the token, such as USDC, using different addresses, thereby increasing the gas cost of adding each new key to the array.\n\nThe attacker's expenditure is approximately $95,000, which is a significant amount, considering the LP's liquidity is locked in the contract for over 10 years.

190,"Vulnerability: Unprotected team allocations\n\nDescription: The `teamAllocations` array is directly accessible and can be modified by anyone. This means that an attacker can manipulate the `teamAllocations` array to steal funds from team members.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call the `_vestingCheck` function with a modified `teamAllocations` array to steal funds from team members.\n\nExample:\n```\nfunction _vestingCheck(address user, uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {\n    teamAllocations[user] = 0; // set team member allocation to 0\n    uint256 initialAllocation = seedAllocations[user];\n    // rest of the code\n}\n```\nThere is no vulnerability.","The `unstake()` function, responsible for calculating the vested amount, contains a critical flaw that restricts team members from unstaking their initial allocation indefinitely. This issue arises from the `_vestingCheck()` function, which returns a value of 0 for team members when calculating the vested amount.\n\nThe `_vestingCheck()` function is designed to determine the vested amount based on the block timestamp and the vesting schedule. However, for team members, the function returns 0, effectively preventing them from unstaking their initial allocation. This is because the function checks if the team member's allocation is greater than 0, and if so, returns 0, regardless of the block timestamp.\n\nFurthermore, the `stake()` function, which is responsible for updating the staked amount, incorrectly assumes that team members are not eligible to stake. As a result, team members who have staked additionally are also unable to unstake their initial allocation. This vulnerability creates a situation where team members are permanently locked into their initial allocation, without the ability to unstake or adjust their stake."
191,"There is a vulnerability in the code. An attacker can take advantage of the vulnerability by injecting malicious data into the `_createDeposit` function. This can lead to an infinite loop and cause the contract to run indefinitely, consuming gas and potentially causing the contract to fail.\n\nThe attacking vector is the `_createDeposit` function, which is vulnerable due to the lack of proper input validation. An attacker can manipulate the input parameters to cause the contract to enter an infinite loop.","The vulnerability is related to the unintended behavior of a vault when LP tokens are injected between the deposit and withdrawal steps. This occurs when a user deposits or withdraws tokens in a vault, which involves two steps: saving the vault's state and making a request to GMX. During this process, an attacker can send LP tokens to the contract, causing the vault to behave unexpectedly.\n\nIn the deposit scenario, the attacker can inject LP tokens between the two steps, allowing them to receive Vault shares for the injected tokens without leveraging them. This can lead to a situation where the user receives shares for tokens that were not leveraged, resulting in unintended behavior.\n\nIn the withdrawal scenario, the attacker can inject LP tokens between the two steps, allowing them to fail the afterWithdrawChecks by sending the same amount of LP tokens as the user wants to withdraw. This can be exploited by sending enough LP tokens to make the lpAmt as large as it was before the withdrawal, causing the `InsufficientLPTokensBurned` error to be reverted.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the vault's behavior, potentially leading to unintended consequences, such as altering the debt amount for TokenB and the leverage."
192,"There is a vulnerability in the code.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can manipulate the `_owners` array and the `_currentSignerCount` variable to add a new signer without replacing any invalid owners.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the `_swapSigner` function, the code checks if the current owner is not a valid signer by calling the `isValidSigner` function. If the owner is not a valid signer, the code swaps the owner with the new signer using the `swapOwner` function.\n\nHowever, the code does not check if the new signer is actually a valid signer. An attacker can manipulate the `_owners` array and the `_currentSignerCount` variable to add a new signer without replacing any invalid owners. For example, an attacker can add a new signer to the `_owners` array and set the `_currentSignerCount` variable to 1. Then, the `_swapSigner` function will add the new signer without replacing any invalid owners, and the attacker can call the function again to add more signers without replacing any invalid owners.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the new signer is a valid signer before swapping it with the current owner.","The `claimSigner()` function is designed to manage the addition of new signers to a safe, ensuring that the maximum number of signers is not exceeded. When a new user attempts to claim a signer, the function checks if there are already the maximum number of owners on the safe. If there are, it iterates through the existing owners to identify any invalid signers and swaps them out for the new signer. However, the loop used to perform this check contains an off-by-one error, which causes the function to miss the final owner in the iteration.\n\nThis issue arises when the maximum number of owners is reached, and the function attempts to identify and swap out invalid signers. The loop iterates up to `_ownerCount - 1`, effectively skipping the last owner in the array. As a result, the function fails to check the validity of the final owner and does not perform the necessary swap, leading to the rejection of the new signer.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who attempts to claim a signer when the maximum number of owners is already reached, allowing them to bypass the intended security mechanism and add an invalid signer to the safe."

The `sharesOwed` value is calculated using the `convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens` function, which is then added to the `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived` variable. However, this value is not updated to reflect the accumulation of staking rewards during the withdrawal period.\n\nAs a result, when claiming rewards, the `amountOut` calculation does not account for the portion of staking rewards accumulated during the withdrawal period, effectively rendering withdrawing users unable to earn any rewards while waiting for their withdrawal to be completed.

The attacker can repeatedly call the function with different new toggle values, each time stealing the nonce of the previous call.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in this code.","The vulnerability arises when an administrator attempts to change the toggle address of a hat, which is a critical component in a smart contract-based system. The `changeHatToggle` function updates the `toggle` address to a new value provided by the administrator. However, if the toggle address is a contract, the update is not immediately reflected in the local state of the hat. This can lead to unexpected changes in the status of the hat, as the administrator may not be aware that the toggle address has reverted to its previous state.\n\nWhen a contract toggle address is updated, the administrator expects the hat to remain in its current state until a change is made. However, due to the asynchronous nature of the update, a malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by sandwiching their transaction between the update to the EOA and the administrator's attempt to toggle the hat off. This can result in the hat being turned back on, potentially leading to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information or malicious actions.\n\nIn a scenario where hats are used for purposes like multisig signing, this vulnerability can have significant implications.

This function updates the `_nodeIndex` variable, which is then used in the `SignerInformation` contract to update the `index` variable. Since the `_nodeIndex` variable is not properly initialized, it can be manipulated to cause a reentrancy attack.\n\nFor example, the attacker can call the `deposit` function multiple times in quick succession, each time updating the `_nodeIndex` variable and causing the `index` variable to be updated. This can lead to the attacker being able to withdraw their deposit multiple times, causing a loss to the contract.","The `removeNode` function in the NodeRegistry contract is responsible for removing a node from the `Nodes` array. This process involves copying the last node in the array to the `_nodeIndex` of the node to be removed, and then decreasing the array size. Additionally, the `SignerInformation` struct, which stores information about each node, also needs to be updated when a node is removed. Specifically, the `index` field in the `SignerInformation` struct needs to be adjusted to reflect the new position of the node in the array.\n\nHowever, the `removeNode` function casts the `index` field to a `uint64` when updating the `SignerInformation` struct. This is unnecessary, as the `index` field is already defined as a `uint` in the `SignerInformation` struct. Moreover, this casting can potentially lead to truncation of the index value if the node being removed has an index greater than `uint64_max`. This could result in an inconsistency in the contract, as the `index` field in the `SignerInformation` struct would no longer accurately reflect the node's position in the array."
196,"Vulnerability: Lack of distinction between functions\n\nDescription: The functions setApprovalForERC20 and transferERC20 are identical, with the only difference being the input parameters. This lack of distinction between the two functions can lead to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the setApprovalForERC20 function with the correct parameters, which would approve a certain amount of tokens to be transferred to a specific address. However, instead of transferring the tokens, the attacker could call the transferERC20 function, which would transfer the approved amount of tokens to the attacker's address instead of the intended recipient.\n\nOutput: There ids no vulnerability.","The vulnerability lies in the implementation of certain ERC20 tokens, which do not adhere to the standard interface for ERC20 token interactions.

This means that if the approval or transfer operation fails, the transaction will silently revert without raising an exception or providing any indication of the failure. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities in smart contracts that rely on these tokens.\n\nFor example, in the provided code snippets, the `setApprovalForERC20` and `transferERC20` functions call the `approve` and `transfer` methods of the `IERC20` contract without checking the return value.

However, if the last epoch is finalized and not cancelled, the transaction is also allowed to proceed. This can lead to a double spend attack, where an attacker can spend the same token twice.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can create two transactions, one for a successful bid and one for cancelling the bid. The attacker can then use the first transaction to spend the tokens and the second transaction to cancel the bid. Since the codeblock allows the transaction to proceed if the last epoch is either not finalized and cancelled or finalized and not cancelled, the attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability and double spend the tokens.","The `processAuction()` function in the `VaultAdmin.sol` contract is vulnerable to being called multiple times by the keeper if the auction is canceled.

Specifically, the code checks if the auction is either not finalized (`!finalized`) and canceled (`cancelled`), or if it is finalized (`finalized`) and not canceled (`!cancelled`). However, when the auction is in a canceled state, the `cancelled` variable is set to `true`, causing the condition to always evaluate to `true`.\n\nAs a result, the code within the `processAuction()` function will execute multiple times if the auction is canceled, potentially leading to unintended consequences."

210,"There is a vulnerability in the code where an attacker can manipulate the exchange rate and take advantage of the system.\n\nThe vulnerability is in the `testMintRedeemSandwich` function, specifically in the `increaseTotalSupply` function. This function uses the `mint` and `approve` functions of the `daiMock` and `uToken` contracts, respectively. The `mint` function allows the contract to create new tokens, and the `approve` function allows the contract to approve a certain amount of tokens for a specific contract to use.\n\nThe vulnerability arises when the `increaseTotalSupply` function is called with a large amount of ether, which causes the `daiMock` contract to mint a large number of new tokens. The `uToken` contract then approves the `daiMock` contract to use these new tokens.\n\nAn attacker can manipulate the exchange rate by borrowing a large amount of ether from the `uToken` contract and then redeeming the borrowed tokens for new tokens. This causes the `uToken` contract to mint new tokens, which are then approved by the `daiMock` contract. The attacker can then manipulate the exchange rate by calling the `mint` and `approve` functions multiple times, causing the `daiMock` contract to mint and approve a large number of new tokens.\n\nThe attacker can then use the manipulated exchange rate to their advantage by borrowing a large amount of ether from the `uToken` contract and then redeeming the borrowed tokens for new tokens. This causes the `uToken` contract to mint new tokens, which are then approved by the `daiMock` contract. The attacker can then use the new tokens to their advantage, such as by selling them on an exchange for a profit.","The `exchangeRateStored()` function in the `uToken` contract allows an attacker to perform a front-running attack on repayments. This vulnerability arises from the fact that `_repayBorrowFresh()` increases the `totalRedeemable` value, which affects the final exchange rate calculation used in functions such as `mint()` and `redeem()`. \n\nAn attacker can exploit this by minting `UTokens` beforehand, and then redeeming them after the front-run repayment. Since `totalRedeemable` value is increased after every repayment, the attacker can always obtain profits. This is achieved by manipulating the exchange rate calculation, allowing the attacker to mint and redeem tokens at a favorable rate.\n\nThe attacker can perform this attack by minting tokens before a repayment is executed, and then redeeming them after the repayment. This allows the attacker to take advantage of the increased `totalRedeemable` value, resulting in a profitable exchange rate."
211,"There is a vulnerability in the code. An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the collateral val variable.\n\nThe vulnerability is in the calculation of collateralval. The code multiplies the balance of the collateral token by the price of the token in USD, and then divides it by the price of the base asset in USD. However, the price of the base asset is not taken into account in the calculation of collateralval.\n\nThis means that an attacker can manipulate the price of the base asset to make the collateral val variable larger than it should be. For example, if the attacker controls the price of the base asset, they can make it seem like there is more collateral available than there actually is. This would allow the attacker to borrow more tokens than they should be able to, and potentially steal them.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to control the price of the base asset and the collateral val variable. They could do this by manipulating the price of the base asset or by manipulating the balance of the collateral token.\n\nThe vulnerability is in the following code block:\n```\nuint256 collateralval = IERC20Upgradeable(collateral[i].token).balanceOf(USSD) * 1e18 / (10**IERC20MetadataUpgradeable(collateral[i].token).decimals()) * collateral[i].oracle.getPriceUSD() / 1e18;\n```\nThe attacking vector is through manipulating the price of the base asset.","The rebalancing process, triggered in response to a peg-down event, attempts to sell collateral to maintain a stable asset ratio. However, the calculation for determining the amount of collateral to sell can underflow, leading to potential reverts.\n\nDuring the rebalancing process, the `rebalance()` function calculates the amount of collateral to sell (`amountToSellUnits`) based on the current collateral value (`collateralval`) and the remaining amount to buy (`amountToBuyLeftUSD`). The calculation involves subtracting `amountBefore` from the current balance of the base asset (`IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore`).\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that `amountToBuyLeftUSD` will always be greater than the result of the subtraction, which can lead to an underflow condition. This can occur when the collateral value (`collateralval`) is greater than the remaining amount to buy (`amountToBuyLeftUSD`), causing the subtraction to result in a value that is greater than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`.\n\nThis underflow condition can occur in two scenarios:\n\n1. When `collateralval` is greater than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, the calculation for `amountToSellUnits` may not accurately reflect the proportion of `amountToBuyLeftUSD` against `collateralval`, potentially resulting in a larger-than-expected return of the base asset.\n2. When `collateralval` is less than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, the calculation may not guarantee that the result of the subtraction (`IERC20Upgradeable(baseAsset).balanceOf(USSD) - amountBefore`) is less than `amountToBuyLeftUSD`, leading to potential reverts.\n\nThe underflow condition can occur due to the use of `uint256` arithmetic, which can result in overflow or underflow when performing calculations involving large values."
212,"Vulnerability: Double spend attack\n\nDescription:\nThe code contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to double spend the user's funds. This vulnerability is present in the `createUniswapRangeOrder` function.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can manipulate the `inversed` variable to trigger the `safeTransferFrom` function twice, effectively double spending the user's funds.\n\nFor example, if the `inversed` variable is set to `true` (i.e., the user's collateral asset is `token0`), the attacker can call the `createUniswapRangeOrder` function again after the first call, setting `inversed` to `false` (i.e., the user's asset is `token1`). This would trigger the `safeTransferFrom` function again, effectively double spending the user's funds.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this vulnerability, the code should check the `inversed` variable before calling the `safeTransferFrom` function. This can be done by adding a check for `inversed` in the `safeTransferFrom` function, or by using a separate function to handle the transfer and check the `inversed` variable there.","The `createUniswapRangeOrder()` function in the smart contract is vulnerable to a potential issue where it charges the manager's funds instead of the pool's funds. This occurs when the function is called from the manager flow or pool-induced from `hedgeDelta()`. \n\nThe function assumes that the sender is the parent liquidity pool, which is incorrect. Specifically, the code checks the balance of the pool, but transfers the funds from the sender's account. This can lead to unintended consequences, as the order will use the manager's funds instead of the pool's funds.\n\nThe issue arises in the following code block, where the function checks the balance of the pool and attempts to transfer the remaining amount from the sender's account. However, since the sender is not the pool, the transfer will actually come from the manager's account, effectively charging the manager's funds.\n\n```\nif (inversed && balance < amountDesired) {\n    // collat = 0\n    uint256 transferAmount = amountDesired - balance;\n    uint256 parentPoolBalance = \n        ILiquidityPool(parentLiquidityPool).getBalance(address(token0));\n    if (parentPoolBalance < transferAmount) { revert \n        CustomErrors.WithdrawExceedsLiquidity(); \n    }\n    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(address(token0), msg.sender, \n     address(this), transferAmount);\n```\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of ensuring that the correct account is used for fund transfers in smart contract functions, particularly when multiple accounts are involved."

The attacker calls the `setNumTokensSellToAddToLiquidity` function with a large value for `numTokens`.\n2. The contract executes the function and sets the `numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity` state variable to the input value.\n3.

The attacker can then take advantage of the action performed by the contract, such as draining the liquidity pool.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the contract should use a state variable that is not directly accessible from outside the contract, and the function should not be marked as `external` and `onlyOwner`.",
214,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe codeblock contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the `_claimArcadeum` function. The function transfers `arcadeumCoin` tokens from the contract to the `_recipient` address using the `safeTransferFrom` function. However, it does not wait for the transfer to be completed before calling the `batchMint` function, which could lead to a reentrancy attack.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could call the `_claimArcadeum` function multiple times, each time transferring a smaller amount of `arcadeumCoin` tokens to themselves using the `batchMint` function. This would allow the attacker to mint more `arcadeumCoin` tokens than they should have, as the `batchMint` function would be called before the `safeTransferFrom` function is completed.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix the reentrancy vulnerability, the `_claimArcadeum` function should wait for the `safeTransferFrom` function to be completed before calling the `batchMint` function. This can be done by adding a `state` variable that is set to `false` before the `safeTransferFrom` function is called, and set to `true` after the transfer is completed. The `batchMint` function can then be called only if the `state` variable is `true`.","The `_buy` function of the `EternalHeroesFactory` contract is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack, which allows an attacker to manipulate the price of Eternal Heroes. This vulnerability arises from the fact that the contract does not properly handle the refund process before minting tokens to the recipient.\n\nWhen a buyer initiates a purchase, the contract calculates the refund amount (`refundAmount`) by subtracting the total cost (`total_cost`) from the `_arcAmount`. If the refund amount is greater than zero, the contract transfers the refund amount to the recipient using the `safeTransferFrom` function. However, this transfer is not atomic, allowing an attacker to exploit the re-entrancy vulnerability.\n\nThe attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `_buy` function, buying more items with the old price before the price increases after every `N` items are minted. This allows the attacker to accumulate a large quantity of Eternal Heroes at a discounted price, effectively manipulating the market price.\n\nThe attacker's strategy involves repeatedly calling the `_buy` function, buying more items with the old price, and then waiting for the price to increase before repeating the process. This creates a re-entrancy loop, where the attacker can continuously buy and sell Eternal Heroes at the old price, exploiting the vulnerability to accumulate a large quantity of tokens."

218,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The internal accounting of the vault balance for a given bAsset may diverge from the actual token balance in the lending pool, violating a fundamental correctness property. This discrepancy can occur due to the way the lending pool integration, specifically Compound, updates the vault balance.\n\nThe issue arises when a transaction is executed, and the amount deposited into the pool is not equal to the amount received by the mAsset contract, as the integration contract assumes. This assumption is based on the notion that no transaction fees are charged for token transfers. However, in reality, fees can be charged, leading to a mismatch between the vault balance and the actual token balance.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where the current balance in the lending pool is 0. When a user deposits an amount X into the pool, their balance after the deposit may be less than X, even if the underlying token does not charge transfer fees. This is due to rounding errors, but in theory, a lending pool could also charge fees, leading to further discrepancies.\n\nThe vault balance is updated in the `Masset._mintTo` function based on the amount returned by the integration. However, this update may not accurately reflect the actual token balance in the lending pool, leading to a temporary violation of the correctness property. Although the vault balance is eventually readjusted when interest is collected, this may take around 30 minutes, which can result in a significant period of divergence.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, a user may attempt to redeem a large amount of mAsset for DAI while the interest collection has not yet been triggered. In this case, the redemption may fail due to the discrepancy between the vault balance and the actual token balance in the lending pool."

The attacker can then call the `_to.call{value: _value}` function again, passing a small amount of gas, and the reverts will cause the contract to revert to its previous state, effectively draining the contract's funds.","The Postman's message delivery service allows for cross-chain message transmission, where users can specify parameters such as the sender, receiver, fee, value, message number, and calldata. The Postman estimates the gas required for message delivery on the destination chain, ensuring that the fees paid by the user are sufficient to cover the costs. However, this mechanism also enables the Postman to deliver a message incorrectly while still collecting the fees.\n\nA potential scenario arises when the `_to` address makes a low-level call to another address, `x`, without verifying the success of the sub-call. If the Postman provides gas that allows the top-level call to succeed, but the low-level call to `x` fails silently, the Postman will still collect the fees for claiming the message, despite the message not being delivered correctly.\n\nIn this scenario, the `_to` address does not check the success of the call to `x`, and the Postman can deliver the message incorrectly while still collecting the fees. This vulnerability allows the Postman to exploit the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) by selecting messages with higher fees first and delivering them before others, while also enabling the Postman to deliver messages incorrectly and still claim the fees."

Specifically, the attacker can call the `getPriceInEth` function with a specific value for the `token` parameter, which will cause the `price` variable to be set to that value. Since the `price` variable is used in the calculation of the `slowFilterPrice` and `fastFilterPrice` variables, an attacker can manipulate the values of these variables by manipulating the `price` variable.\n\nFor example, if the `getPriceInEth` function is called with the value `36e18` for the `token` parameter, the `price` variable will be set to `36e18`, and the `slowFilterPrice` and `fastFilterPrice` variables will be calculated using this value. However, if the `getPriceInEth` function is called with a different value for the `token` parameter, the `price` variable will be set to a different value, and the `slowFilterPrice` and `fastFilterPrice` variables will be calculated using this new value. This can be used to manipulate the values of the `slowFilterPrice` and `fastFilterPrice` variables, which can be used to manipulate the behavior of the `updatePricingInfo` function.\n\nTherefore, the vulnerability is that the `price` variable is not properly protected against manipulation by external contracts.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.","The `price` variable at Line 137 is denominated in 18 decimals, as the `getPriceInEth` function consistently returns the `price` in 18 decimal precision.

After 18 rounds of initialization (INIT_SAMPLE_COUNT == 18), the `existing._initAcc` will equal 36 ETH (36e18).

225,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The vulnerability lies in the implementation of DepositReceipt_ETH and DepositReciept_USDC, which utilize a swap router to check the value of liquidity by swapping 100 tokens. This approach is problematic for high-value tokens like WBTC, as the massive value of swapping 100 WBTC tokens would likely result in a failed slippage check, causing the deposit receipt to revert. Additionally, WETH, which experiences an 11% slippage when trading 100 tokens, would also be affected, making it incompatible with DepositReceipt_ETH.\n\nThe issue is further exacerbated by the fact that DepositReceipt_ETH only supports tokens with 18 decimal places, which would require the use of DepositReciept_USDC for WETH/USDC pairs. This could lead to compatibility issues and potential trapping of user deposits. Moreover, the fluctuating liquidity could make this a significant problem, as reduced liquidity after deposits are made could result in permanent trapping of user deposits.\n\nThe code snippets provided demonstrate the problematic logic, where the `getAmountOut` function attempts to swap 100 tokens from `token1` to USDC, which would fail for high-value tokens like WBTC due to slippage requirements.

However, the `_endingDelegations` list is not utilized in any other part of the code, suggesting that it serves no purpose beyond its limited usage in the `getPurchasedAmount` function.\n\nThe fact that the `getPurchasedAmount` function is mostly used after iterating over all delegations of the holder implies that the `_endingDelegations` list is not necessary for the overall functionality of the code. This redundancy could potentially lead to unnecessary complexity and potential issues if not addressed."
227,There is no vulnerability in this codeblock.,"This vulnerability is related to the potential for gas savings by terminating early in a function invocation that is bound to revert. In the `ForgeValidator.validateRedemption` function, there is an opportunity to terminate the execution earlier than necessary, which could result in unnecessary gas consumption.\n\nThe specific issue arises from the conditional statement `if (atLeastOneBecameOverweight) return (false, ""bAssets must remain below max weight"", false);`. This statement checks a condition and, if true, immediately returns a response without continuing to execute the rest of the function. However, if the condition is false, the function would continue to execute, potentially consuming more gas than necessary.\n\nBy terminating early, the function can save gas by avoiding unnecessary computations and operations. This is particularly important in a gas-constrained environment, where every optimization can make a significant difference."
228,There is no vulnerability in this codeblock.,"The `LSTCalculatorBase.sol` contract's deployment process is vulnerable to a slashing event's impact on the initial APR calculation. The contract's `calculateAnnualizedChangeMinZero` function, which is used to calculate the APR between the deployment and the first snapshot taken after `APR_FILTER_INIT_INTERVAL_IN_SEC` (9 days), has a floor of 0. This means that if a slashing event occurs during this initial 9-day period, the function will return 0, and the initial APR and `baseApr` will be set to 0.\n\nThe APR calculation is designed to update at regular intervals of 3 days, with the new APR given a weight of 10% and the older APR given a weight of 90%. However, if the initial APR is set to 0 due to a slashing event, it may take a significant number of updates (up to 28, in the example provided) to reflect the correct APR. This can result in the wrong APR being displayed for up to 3 months, which can have a significant impact on the protocol's allocation decisions and potential yield."
229,"Vulnerability: Owner can set minimum weight to a very small value, causing the contract to always return false for weight checks.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can manipulate the contract owner to set a very small minimum weight, causing the contract to always return false for weight checks. This would allow the attacker to bypass the weight requirement and gain access to the contract's functionality.","The DynamicLiquidTokenConverter input validation vulnerability in the `setMinimumWeight` and `setStepWeight` functions allows an attacker to manipulate the system settings by setting out-of-bounds values for `stepWeight` or `setMinimumWeight`. This can lead to functionality not working correctly, specifically calls to `reduceWeight` may fail. The issue arises from the lack of input validation, which allows the full `uint32` range to be used, effectively allowing values to range from `0%` to `4,294,967,295%`.\n\nThe `setMinimumWeight` and `setStepWeight` functions, which are intended to update system settings, do not properly validate the input values before updating the corresponding variables. This allows an attacker to set arbitrary values for `stepWeight` and `setMinimumWeight`, which can have unintended consequences on the system's behavior."
230,"Vulnerability description:\n\n1. The first codeblock is vulnerable because it does not properly handle the case where `entranceFee` is zero. If `entranceFee` is zero, then `borrowing.feesOwed` will also be zero, but the line `borrowing.feesOwed += entranceFee;` will still attempt to add zero to `borrowing.feesOwed`, which could potentially cause a stack overflow.\n2. The second codeblock is vulnerable because it uses the `mulDiv` function from the `FullMath` library, which is not a standard Solidity library. This could potentially cause issues if the `mulDiv` function is not implemented correctly or if it is patched in a future version of Solidity. Additionally, the code assumes that `feesOwed`, `borrowedAmount`, and `cache.holdTokenDebt` are all non-zero, which could cause issues if they are zero.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability in the first codeblock by setting `entranceFee` to zero and then calling the contract with a large value for `borrowing.feesOwed`. This could cause a stack overflow and potentially allow the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.\n\nAn attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability in the second codeblock by setting `feesOwed`, `borrowedAmount`, or `cache.holdTokenDebt` to zero and then calling the contract with a large value for `harvestedAmt`. This could cause issues with the contract's state and potentially allow the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.","The vulnerability lies in the improper distribution of entrance fees in loans with multiple lenders. Specifically, when a borrower takes out multiple loans, the entrance fees are not credited to each lender individually, but rather are distributed among all lenders. This can result in some lenders losing a portion of their entrance fees.\n\nThe issue arises when the `updateHoldTokenEntranceFee()` function is called, which can cause the entrance fees to be distributed incorrectly. This is because the `feesOwed` variable is updated to include the entrance fee, but the calculation of `feesAmt` in the `loansFeesInfo` array does not take into account the individual entrance fees paid by each lender.\n\nFor instance, if a borrower takes out two loans, one from each lender, and pays an entrance fee of 10 tokens, the first lender will receive only 5 tokens of the entrance fee, while the second lender will receive the remaining 5 tokens. This is because the `feesOwed` variable is updated to include the total entrance fee, rather than the individual entrance fees paid by each lender.\n\nFurthermore, if the entrance fee is increased, new lenders will also lose a portion of their entrance fees. For example, if the entrance fee is increased to 20 tokens, the first lender will receive only 10 tokens, while the second lender will receive the remaining 10 tokens. This is because the `feesOwed` variable is not updated to reflect the increased entrance fee, resulting in an incorrect distribution of fees.\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to unfair treatment of lenders, as some may receive a smaller share of the entrance fees than others, even if they have lent the same amount."
231,"Vulnerability: Infinite loop vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe vulnerability lies in the `for` loop that iterates through the `rewardTokens` array. The loop condition is `i < rewardTokens.length`, which means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the `rewardTokens` array.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `rewardTokens` array to make it grow indefinitely. For example, an attacker could add a new token to the `rewardTokens` array at a very high frequency, causing the length of the array to grow without bound. This would cause the `for` loop to execute infinitely, consuming all of the gas in the contract and potentially causing it to become unresponsive or even crash.\n\nIn this case, the attacker could potentially drain the contract's funds by repeatedly adding new tokens to the `rewardTokens` array and causing the loop to execute infinitely.","AuraSpell's `closePositionFarm` function requires users to swap all reward tokens through the same router, which can lead to liquidity issues and forced losses. This is because it is unlikely that a UniswapV2 router will have sufficient liquidity for all tokens, resulting in users being forced to sell their reward tokens at unfavorable prices.\n\nThe code snippet at `AuraSpell.sol#L193-L203` demonstrates this issue, where all reward tokens are swapped through a single router using the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function. This approach can lead to a situation where users are forced to sell their reward tokens at unfavorable prices, resulting in losses."
232,"Vulnerability: Unprotected function call\n\nDescription: The function `withdrawFromGauge` is not protected by any access control mechanism, such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyApproved`. This means that any user can call this function, potentially causing unintended consequences.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could call the `withdrawFromGauge` function with malicious intent, such as transferring all the tokens from the pooledTokens to themselves.\n\nOutput: There ids no vulnerability.","The vulnerability allows an attacker to steal rewards accumulated by other users by manipulating the depositors. This is achieved by minting a new NFT on their own depositor and then withdrawing it from another user's depositor, effectively transferring the rewards to their own depositor. This can be done by exploiting the `withdrawFromGauge` function, which allows any user to withdraw any NFT that was minted by the same `DepositReceipt`.\n\nThe issue arises because the `withdrawFromGauge` function does not check the ownership of the depositor before allowing the withdrawal. This allows an attacker to withdraw an NFT from another user's depositor, effectively stealing the rewards accumulated by that user. The attacker can then collect the yield on the stolen tokens, while the original owner is left without any rewards.\n\nFor example, in the scenario described, `User A` and `User B` both create a depositor for the same `DepositReceipt` and deposit 100 tokens into their respective depositors. `User B` then calls `withdrawFromGauge` on `Depositor A`, effectively stealing the 100 tokens deposited by `User A`. `User B` can now collect the yield on the stolen tokens, while `User A` is left without any rewards."
233,"Vulnerability: Division by zero\n\nDescription: The codeblock performs a division operation between 1 and the timeTillMatch variable. If the timeTillMatch variable is zero, the division operation will result in a division by zero error.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can manipulate the timeTillMatch variable to be zero, causing the program to crash or revert the transaction. The attacker can also use this vulnerability to drain the contract's funds by repeatedly calling the function with a zero timeTillMatch value.\n\nOutput: There ids no vulnerability.","This vulnerability occurs when the calculation of `shares` involves a division operation before multiplication, which can lead to a loss of precision and accuracy in the distribution of `dittoMatchedShares` to users. Specifically, the `timeTillMatch` value is divided by a constant `1 day` before being multiplied by the `eth` value, which can result in a truncated value.\n\nIn the given example, when `timeTillMatch` is `14.99 days` and `eth` is `1e18`, the expected result would be `14.99e18 shares`. However, due to the division before multiplication, the actual result is `14e18 shares`, which represents a loss of approximately `0.01e18 shares` or `0.71%` of the total shares. This truncated value is then used to distribute `dittoMatchedShares` to users, potentially leading to an unfair distribution of rewards.\n\nThis vulnerability can have significant implications for users who rely on accurate and precise calculations for their rewards, as the truncated value can result in a loss of earnings or an unfair distribution of shares."
234,"Vulnerability: Infinite loop vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe codeblock checks if the validator meets the minimum staking requirement by comparing the sum of the validator nodes and one multiplied by the msr value to the total delegations. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total delegations, the codeblock throws an error. However, the condition for the error is always true because the sum of the validator nodes and one multiplied by the msr value is always greater than or equal to the total delegations. This results in an infinite loop, which can lead to a denial of service attack.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of validator nodes and delegating them to the same address. This will cause the sum of the validator nodes and one multiplied by the msr value to be greater than the total delegations, triggering the infinite loop. The attacker can continue to create more validator nodes and delegate them to the same address, causing the infinite loop to continue and consume resources.","This vulnerability occurs when a validator fails to meet the Minimum Staking Requirement (MSR), which is a critical condition that prevents token holders from switching to a different validator. This situation can arise when a validator does not have sufficient funds to operate a node, thereby rendering it non-functional. As a result, token holders who have delegated their tokens to this validator are unable to transfer their stakes to a more reliable and active validator, potentially leaving their funds stuck with the non-operational validator for an extended period of up to 12 months.\n\nIn this scenario, the following condition is not met: `require((validatorNodes.length + 1) * msr <= delegationsTotal, ""Validator has to meet Minimum Staking Requirement"");`.

This can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `confiscate` function multiple times in quick succession. The attacker would first call the `confiscate` function, which would reduce the coefficient and update the `_effectiveDelegatedToValidator` and `_slashes` arrays. Then, before the `confiscate` function has a chance to execute its next line of code, the attacker would call the `confiscate` function again, effectively reusing the updated values of the arrays. This would result in the attacker being able to steal a larger amount of tokens than intended.\n\nThe vulnerability can be fixed by defining the `reduce` function and ensuring that it cannot be called multiple times in quick succession.","The vulnerability arises from the accumulation of rounding errors in the slashing process, which can lead to inconsistencies in the calculation of various values. Specifically, when slashing occurs, the `_delegatedToValidator` and `_effectiveDelegatedToValidator` values are reduced, but the calculations involve fractions and rounding, which can introduce errors.\n\nThese errors can propagate to other calculations, such as the reduction of `_delegatedByHolderToValidator`, `_delegatedByHolder`, and `_effectiveDelegatedByHolderToValidator` values, which are used to calculate the total delegated amount. The use of these values, which are now subject to rounding errors, can lead to incorrect assumptions about the total delegated amount.\n\nFurthermore, when holders process slashings, they reduce the `_delegatedByHolderToValidator`, `_delegatedByHolder`, and `_effectiveDelegatedByHolderToValidator` values, which can also introduce rounding errors. These errors can accumulate and lead to inconsistencies in the calculation of the total delegated amount.\n\nAdditionally, when holders are undelegating, they calculate the amount of tokens slashed, which can also introduce rounding errors. The use of these values, which are now subject to rounding errors, can lead to incorrect assumptions about the total delegated amount.\n\nThe vulnerability can lead to two possible scenarios: either the rounding errors can cause an underflow, which can result in a `SafeMath` revert, or the errors can make the values smaller than expected, making it impossible to compare them to zero.

This is because the address is not compatible with the WETH contract on these alternative chains."
241,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\n\nThe vulnerability in this code is a reentrancy vulnerability. This occurs because the function `_transferFromExcluded` modifies the state of the contract by decreasing the `_rOwned` balances of the sender and increasing the `_rOwned` balance of the recipient. However, it does not wait for the transaction to be fully executed before proceeding with the next steps, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling `_transferFromExcluded` with a large amount of tokens and then calling it again immediately after the first call, before the transaction is fully executed. This will cause the contract to execute the first transaction again, effectively stealing the tokens sent to the recipient.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, you can use the ""checks-effects-interactions"" pattern, which involves separating the contract's state modifications from the transaction execution. This can be done by adding a `waitBlock()` function that waits for a certain number of blocks before proceeding with the next steps. This will ensure that the contract's state is not modified until the transaction is fully executed, preventing reentrancy attacks.",
242,"Vulnerability description:\n\n1. In the first codeblock, the `IERC20(outputTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` call returns the total amount of output tokens allocated to the contract. However, this call does not account for any output tokens that have already been released. As a result, the contract may attempt to perform an operation with an incorrect balance of output tokens.\n2. In the second codeblock, the `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function is used to transfer the allocation of output tokens to the user. However, this function does not check if the user has sufficient input tokens to cover the transfer.

An attacker could manipulate the `totalAllocatedOutputToken` and `totalReleasedOutputToken` variables to make the contract believe it has more output tokens than it actually does. This would cause the contract to fail the balance check in the first codeblock, allowing the attacker to perform an operation with an incorrect balance of output tokens.\n2. An attacker could repeatedly call the `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` function to transfer the allocation of output tokens to themselves, without providing any input tokens. This would drain the contract's input tokens, potentially leaving the contract unable to perform its intended function.","The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the `transmuteInstant()` function in the TokenTransmuter contract. Unlike the `transmuteLinear()` function, which checks the availability of output tokens before accepting input tokens, `transmuteInstant()` does not perform any checks, allowing an attacker to drain the output token balance and steal future vested tokens intended for linear distribution.\n\nIn the `transmuteLinear()` function, the contract verifies that there are sufficient output tokens available before processing the input tokens. This ensures that the allocated amount is released across time until fully vested. However, the `transmuteInstant()` function does not have this safeguard, and will execute as long as the function has enough output tokens to satisfy the request.\n\nThis oversight creates a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate the output token balance, potentially stealing tokens intended for linear distribution. For instance, an attacker could initiate a large instant transmute, depleting the output token balance, and then claim the vested tokens intended for linear distribution. This could result in users not receiving their allocated tokens, compromising the integrity of the token distribution mechanism."

This lack of constraint creates a vulnerability.\n\nThe functions `addValidators` and `removeValidators` update the `block.number` to signify the last validator edit, but do not enforce this constraint on subsequent edits. The absence of publicly accessible functions to retrieve this value further complicates the situation, making it unclear why this constraint is necessary.\n\nThe code snippet `if (operators.value[_operatorIndex].limit < _limit && StakingContractStorageLib.getLastValidatorEdit() > _snapshot) { revert LastEditAfterSnapshot(); }` attempts to ensure that the `_snapshot` is ahead of the last validator edit before increasing the limit.

This manipulation can result in the attacker being able to withdraw a large number of assets, even though they only deposited a small amount of tokens into the pool. This is a utilization manipulation attack, not a share inflation attack.","The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the utilization of the protocol, which is calculated as assets borrowed divided by assets loaned, to exceed 100%. This is achieved by depositing tokens into the lending pool and then borrowing a larger amount of assets, effectively creating a utilization rate that is not capped at 100%. This manipulation can result in an extremely high interest rate, allowing the attacker to steal assets from future depositors.\n\nThe attacker can set up this attack by depositing a small amount of assets into the tranche and then using the ERC20 transfer function to transfer a large amount of tokens into the lending pool. They can then borrow the same amount of assets, creating a utilization rate that is far above 100%. This allows the attacker to collect interest on the borrowed assets, which can be withdrawn and stolen from future depositors.\n\nThe attacker can also use this vulnerability to drain the entire protocol by setting up the attack when the initial lending pool is empty. They can then steal assets from subsequent depositors by collecting interest on the borrowed assets.\n\nThe utilization calculation is not capped at 100%, allowing the attacker to manipulate the interest rate to extreme levels.

This enables users to gain free entries for any round, as the system does not explicitly check the token type before processing the deposit.\n\nThe issue is rooted in the fact that the `transferFrom` function signature for both ERC721 and ERC20 tokens is identical, allowing an attacker to call the `transferFrom` function on an ERC20 contract with an amount of 0. This results in the user paying nothing, and the transaction executing successfully, as long as the ERC20 token does not revert on zero transfers.\n\nIn the provided test, a user can make multiple free deposits in the same transaction by utilizing the MKR token, which has a price greater than the `valuePerEntry`.

This vulnerability affects the Emergency vault settlement process, Normal vault settlement, and Post-Maturity vault settlement, which are all supported by Notional's DEXs, including Curve, Balancer V2, Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, and 0x.\n\nThe issue arises from the `emergencySettlementSlippageLimitPercent` being set to 10% in the environment file, which is then used to validate the slippage passed in by the caller. However, when the `callbackData.oracleSlippagePercent` is set to 0%, the transaction will not revert, despite exceeding the designated threshold. This is because the `TradingUtils._getLimitAmount` function sets the `limitAmount` to 0 when the `slippageLimit` is 0, effectively disabling the slippage check.\n\nA malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by setting the `callbackData.oracleSlippagePercent` to 0% during the `settleVaultEmergency` function call, allowing them to bypass the slippage control mechanism and execute the trade without considering the designated threshold."
256,"There is a vulnerability in the code.\n\nThe vulnerability is that the code is using the same variable ""allocation"" for both the linear and instant allocation calculations. This means that if the instant multiplier is set to a value greater than 1, the final allocation will be greater than the intended amount.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by setting the instant multiplier to a value greater than 1, which would result in a larger allocation than intended. The attacker could then use the larger allocation to their advantage, such as by selling the tokens on an exchange or using them for other malicious purposes.","The `linearMultiplier` and `instantMultiplier` variables, used in the `transmute` functions, are implemented as `uint256` data types, which restrict their ability to perform division operations on the `_inputTokenAmount`. This limitation arises from the fact that `uint256` variables can only perform multiplication, not division, as their name suggests.\n\nAs a result, the calculation of the `allocation` variable, which is used to determine the output token amount, is severely restricted. Specifically, the division operation is not performed correctly, leading to an incorrect calculation of the allocation. This issue has a significant impact on the functionality of the protocol, as it prevents vesting pairs where the output tokens are valued more than the input tokens from being used."
257,"Vulnerability description:\nThe code is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `approve` function multiple times in quick succession.\n\nExplanation:\nThe code uses the `approve` function to delegate its tokens to the `IRedeemer` contract. However, the `approve` function does not have a `nonReentrant` modifier, which means that it can be called multiple times in quick succession. An attacker can exploit this by calling the `approve` function multiple times in quick succession, causing the contract to delegate more and more of its tokens to the `IRedeemer` contract. This can lead to a loss of tokens for the contract owner.","The `Marketplace.setPrincipal` function is used to provide a principal token for the base token and maturity when it has not been set yet. This function also requires specifying the protocol that the token belongs to. In the case of the `APWine` protocol, there is a specific block of code that handles the necessary allowance. However, this block of code is not executed when using the `Marketplace.setPrincipal` function.\n\nThe code snippet provided shows that when `APWine` is the protocol, the function checks for the `futureVault` and `interestBearingToken` addresses, and then approves the allowance using the `IRedeemer` contract. However, when using `Marketplace.setPrincipal`, these parameters are not provided, and therefore, the allowance is not set. This can lead to issues for the `Lender` contract, as it will not be able to work correctly with the tokens."

If the input arguments contain sensitive data, such as the address of a user or the amount of a token, an attacker could potentially extract this data by calling the `hash256` function multiple times with different inputs.\n\nFor example, an attacker could call `hash256(abi.encodePacked(userAddress, amount))` and `hash256(abi.encodePacked(userAddress, amount))` to extract the user address and amount, respectively.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call the `hash256` function multiple times with different inputs. The attacker could then use the extracted data to carry out malicious activities, such as stealing funds or impersonating a user.","This vulnerability is related to an unnecessary type correction in the `hash256` function, which is used to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a given input. The function is designed to return a `bytes32` value, which is the expected output of the SHA-256 algorithm.\n\nThe issue arises from the use of the `encodePacked()` function, which is used to concatenate the output of the `sha256` function with itself before converting it to a `bytes32` value. This is unnecessary, as the `sha256` function already returns a `bytes32` value, and the `encodePacked()` function is not required.\n\nThe corrected code should simply call the `sha256` function and return its output as a `bytes32` value, without the need for the `encodePacked()` function. This can be achieved by modifying the `hash256` function as follows:\n\n```\nfunction hash256(bytes memory _b) internal pure returns (bytes32) {\n    return sha256(_b);\n}\n```\n\nBy removing the unnecessary `encodePacked()` function, the code becomes more efficient and easier to understand, reducing the risk of errors and improving maintainability."
260,There is no vulnerability in the provided codeblock.,"The Token Overflow vulnerability is a critical issue that can lead to system halt or loss of funds. It occurs when the token supply is artificially inflated to an extremely large value, causing the safeMath reverts in functions such as `processProposal` and `cancelProposal` to fail. This can result in unexpected behavior, including the potential loss of funds.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can be triggered by any function that utilizes the `internalTransfer()` method. This method is used to transfer tokens between accounts, and its use can lead to an overflow condition. For example, the `max` function, which is used to determine the maximum value between two `uint256` variables, can also result in an overflow if the input values are extremely large.\n\nThis vulnerability was identified by Heiko Fisch in a Telegram chat, highlighting the importance of careful consideration when working with token supplies and safeMath reverts in smart contracts."

If the fee is greater than zero, the function transfers the fee to the beneficiary's account. However, the function does not include any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks. If an attacker calls the `_transfer` function multiple times in quick succession, they can exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to steal more funds by transferring the fee back to themselves.","This vulnerability occurs when a batch is canceled, resulting in the failure to return fees paid by traders for buy orders. The issue arises from the fact that the beneficiary account is not accessible when the batch is canceled, thereby preventing the return of fees. In contrast, fees for sell orders are successfully returned to traders in the event of a batch cancellation.\n\nThe code snippet responsible for this vulnerability is as follows:\n```\nuint256 fee = `_value.mul(buyFeePct).div(PCT_BASE);\nuint256 value = `_value.sub(fee);\n\n// collect fee and collateral\nif (fee > 0) {\n    `_transfer(_buyer, beneficiary, _collateral, fee);\n}\n_transfer(_buyer, address(reserve), _collateral, value);\n```\nIn this code, the `_transfer` function is used to transfer the fee and collateral to the beneficiary and reserve accounts, respectively.

This would cause the code to fail and potentially expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to the contract.,"The `emergencyClosePosition` function in the `PartyBFacetImpl` contract can be exploited by PartyA to block PartyB's ability to close positions in emergency situations. This is achieved by manipulating the position's status to `QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING` before PartyB can execute the `emergencyClosePosition` function.\n\nWhen the emergency mode is activated, PartyB gains the ability to close positions without requiring user requests. However, PartyA can take advantage of this by pre-emptively calling the `requestToClosePosition` function with a minimum quantity to close (e.g., 1 wei) against their positions. This changes the status to `QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING`, effectively blocking PartyB's ability to close the positions in emergency situations.\n\nPartyA can also block PartyB's on-demand emergency close by front-running PartyB's `emergencyClosePosition` transaction with their own `requestToClosePosition` call. This would revert the quote's status back to `QuoteStatus.OPENED`, allowing PartyA to block the emergency close again. A sophisticated attacker could repeatedly revert the quote's status back to `QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING` to maintain the block, rendering the emergency close functionality ineffective."
265,There is no vulnerability in the provided codeblocks.,"When a market is removed from a vault by setting its weight to 0, the vault's leverage in that market is unexpectedly set to its maximum possible value, putting the vault's position at risk of liquidation. This occurs because the vault's rebalancing process, which is triggered by the removal of the market, immediately withdraws the maximum possible collateral from the market, leaving the vault's leverage at its maximum possible value.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly concerning when the vault's position in the removed market cannot be closed due to high skew, resulting in a non-zero minimum position. In such cases, the vault's position remains at maximum leverage, increasing the risk of liquidation and potential losses for depositors.\n\nThe issue arises from the way the vault's collateral is calculated during rebalancing. When a market is removed, its collateral is set to the minimum valid value, allowing the vault to maintain a position at maximum leverage. However, this calculation does not take into account the actual position size, which can lead to unintended consequences.\n\nIn the provided test scenario, the removal of the market with weight 0 results in the vault's position remaining at its original value, while the collateral is reduced to its minimum allowed value. This demonstrates the potential risk of liquidation and loss of funds for depositors."
266,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this code, the `cancel()` function is designed to cancel a transfer of tokens from one address to another.

If the recipient has any tokens in their balance, the function transfers them back to the recipient.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `cancel()` function after sending the tokens to the contract. The attacker would do this by first calling the `transfer()` function to send the tokens to the contract, and then immediately calling the `cancel()` function.\n\nIn this way, the attacker can trick the contract into transferring the tokens back to the attacker's address, effectively stealing the tokens that were sent to the contract. This is a reentrancy attack because the `cancel()` function is called multiple times, allowing the attacker to exploit the vulnerability repeatedly.","The vulnerability arises when a malicious recipient is added to the USDC blacklist, rendering the `cancel()` function ineffective. This function is intended to send the vested USDC to the recipient and cancel future payments. However, if the recipient is blacklisted, the `cancel()` function will not execute as expected.\n\nWhen a payer attempts to call `cancel()`, it sends the vested USDC to the recipient and updates the contract's internal state to reflect the cancellation. However, if the recipient is malicious and has been added to the USDC blacklist, they can prevent the payer from canceling the payment stream and withdrawing future payments. This is because the `cancel()` function relies on the recipient's address being valid and not blacklisted.\n\nThe code snippet provided shows the `cancel()` function, which checks the recipient's balance and, if it's greater than zero, transfers the balance to the recipient using the `safeTransfer()` method. However, if the recipient is blacklisted, this transfer will not occur, effectively rendering the `cancel()` function ineffective."
267,"Vulnerability: Lack of input validation\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending maliciously crafted transactions to the contract address.\n\nExplanation: The codeblock does not perform any input validation, which means that any user can interact with the contract by sending transactions to the contract address. This can lead to a security vulnerability, as an attacker can send transactions that manipulate the state of the contract, such as transferring funds or executing malicious code.\n\nThere is no vulnerability.","The Makefile's target ""all"" specifies a dependency on the targets ""clean"" and ""solc"", implying a sequential execution order.

However, due to the absence of delimiters, the actual key written to is `<settingNameSpace>.rewards.claimsgroup.amount<_contractName>`. This discrepancy occurs because there is no delimiter between `claims|group` and `amount|<_contractName>`.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `setSettingRewardsClaimer` function is used to update the rewards claimer settings. The function concatenates strings using `abi.encodePacked` to generate keys for storing and retrieving data.

270,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblock.,"The `_collectFees` function in the LMPVault protocol is vulnerable to a manipulation attack that can result in the loss of fees. The function only collects fees when the NAV/Share exceeds the last recorded NAV/Share, which can be exploited by malicious users to lock in the NAV/Share at a high value, thereby preventing the collection of fees in the future.\n\nDuring the initialization phase, the `navPerShareHighMark` is set to `1`, effectively setting the initial NAV/Share ratio to 1:1. However, if the price of the LP token in the associated DV (Decentralized Vault) increases suddenly, the `currentNavPerShare` will also increase, potentially exceeding the `navPerShareHighMark`. This can occur even if the number of shares minted is small, such as 0.5 shares.\n\nWhen the `updateDebtReporting` function is called, the profit is calculated as the difference between the current NAV/Share and the `navPerShareHighMark`. In this case, the profit is `0.4 ETH * 0.5 Shares = 0.2 ETH`, which is a small amount due to the limited number of shares. The fee collected is `0.02 ETH` (~40 USD), which is negligible.\n\nHowever, the `navPerShareHighMark` is set to the current NAV/Share value, effectively locking in the high NAV/Share value. This means that even if the price of the LP token falls back to its expected range, the protocol will not collect fees until the NAV/Share exceeds the locked-in value of `1.4`. This can result in a significant loss of fees for the protocol, as it may take a long time to reach the `1.4` threshold or the spike may be temporary and never reach that value again.\n\nIn this scenario, the protocol only collects a small amount of fees (`0.02 ETH` ~40 USD) when the NAV/Share is between `1.0` and `1.4`, which is an unintended consequence of the current implementation."
271,"There is no vulnerability in the first codeblock.

However, in the current implementation, there is no approval mechanism in place before calling these functions, resulting in the failure of functions such as `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw`, and `redeem`. This means that users are unable to sell tokens through ERC5095.\n\nThe `sellUnderlying` and `sellPrincipalToken` functions are designed to transfer tokens from the msg.sender to the pool, but without approval, the transfer fails.

The attacker could then call the function again, setting the `sellMarketingFee` to a large value, effectively draining the contract's funds.\n\nExplanation: The `updateSellFees` function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it modifies the contract's state (e.g., the `sellMarketingFee` variable) while relying on external calls (e.g., the `onlyOwner` modifier). This allows an attacker to manipulate the function's behavior by calling it multiple times in quick succession. In this case, the attacker could drain the contract's funds by repeatedly setting the `sellMarketingFee` to a very small value, causing the `sellTotalFees` calculation to always be less than or equal to 99, and then setting the `sellMarketingFee` to a large value in the subsequent calls.",

The attacker can use a bot or other automated means to quickly send transactions to claim rewards for multiple epochs.","The `RewardsDistributor` contract's `claimRewards()` function allows users to claim their rewards for a specific epoch. While the function checks if the user has already claimed rewards for that epoch, it does not verify if the user has any associated rewards at all. This oversight can lead to the `ClaimedRewards` event being spammed by malicious users, particularly on low-gas chains.\n\nIn the `claimRewards()` function, the contract iterates through an array of epoch numbers and checks if the user has already claimed rewards for each epoch. If the user has not claimed rewards for a particular epoch, the contract sets a flag indicating that the rewards have been claimed and then transfers the rewards to the user. However, if the user does not have any associated rewards, the contract does not prevent the `ClaimedRewards` event from being emitted, which can lead to unnecessary and potentially malicious events being triggered."

However, the current implementation still attempts to withdraw 0 from the plugin, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nThe `validateWithdraw()` function in the Aave V2 plugin, which is called by `_withdrawFromPlugin()`, does not allow 0 withdrawals. This means that when `_withdrawFromPlugin()` tries to withdraw 0 from the plugin, the `validateWithdraw()` function will revert, causing the entire rebalancing process to fail.\n\nFurthermore, the `removePlugin()` function also calls `_withdrawFromPlugin()`, even when the plugin's balance is 0.

If a user has less liquidity in the pool than their position's collateral amount, the function will revert, but the user will still have lost their collateral.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `_redeemPosition` function with a user who has less liquidity in the pool than their position's collateral amount. The attacker would need to have control over the lending proxy and the Uniswap V3 NPM contract. The attacker would send enough collateral to the lending proxy to cover the user's position, and then call the `_redeemPosition` function. The attacker would then receive the user's collateral and the extra coll tokens, while the user loses their collateral and is left with nothing.","The UniswapV3NPM contract allows users to increase liquidity to any NFT, which can be exploited by an attacker to prevent a position from being closed. When a position is being redeemed, the contract only decreases the initial liquidity of the NFT and then burns it. However, if the liquidity of the NFT is not zero, the burning process will fail.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by increasing the liquidity of the NFT to a non-zero value, effectively preventing the position from being closed. This can be done by calling the `increaseLiquidity` function with a non-zero liquidity amount. Later, when the position expires, the attacker can liquidate the position, allowing them to reap the benefits of the increased liquidity.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the position's liquidity, enabling them to prevent the position from being closed and potentially gain an unfair advantage."
282,"There is a vulnerability in the `upgradeAgent` function. The function checks if the caller is the owner of the agent and if the agentId is 0 before upgrading the agent. However, it does not check if the new agent has been successfully deployed before unregistering the old agent.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `upgradeAgent` function with a malicious address as the agent parameter. The function would revert with the ""Unauthorized"" error message, but the attacker could still unregister the old agent and transfer funds to the new agent.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to call the `upgradeAgent` function multiple times with different malicious addresses as the agent parameter. Each time, the function would revert with the ""Unauthorized"" error message, but the attacker could still unregister the old agent and transfer funds to the new agent. The attacker could continue to do this until they have successfully transferred all of the funds from the old agent to the new agent.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the code.","The upgrade mechanism for agents in this system allows the owner to initiate an upgrade process, even if no new implementation is available. This vulnerability presents multiple potential issues.\n\nFirstly, upgrading to the current implementation of the agent can lead to unintended consequences, as the `migrateMiner` function is not being called. This means that miners will remain with the outdated agent, resulting in the loss of funds.\n\nSecondly, the owner can inadvertently trigger multiple upgrades simultaneously, leading to a loss of funds. This is particularly concerning, as the owner has no control over the new version of the agent.\n\nFurthermore, the current implementation does not provide a mechanism for the owner to specify the deployer's address, which is essential for increasing decentralization. By passing the deployer's address as a parameter, the owner would have more control over the upgrade process and could ensure that the new agent is deployed by a trusted entity.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of carefully designing and implementing upgrade mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of the system."
283,"Vulnerability: Lack of proper validation of bAssets and integrators\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can forge bAssets and integrators to manipulate the Forge function and gain control over the bAssets.\n\nExplanation: The ForgePropsMulti struct does not have any validation checks for the bAssets, integrators, and indexes. An attacker can forge these values to manipulate the Forge function and gain control over the bAssets. For example, an attacker can forge a bAsset with a large balance and then use the Forge function to transfer the bAsset to themselves. Similarly, an attacker can forge the integrators and indexes to manipulate the Forge function.","The `ForgePropsMulti` struct contains an unused `isValid` field, which is always set to `true`. This field is intended to serve as a flag indicating that the associated `bAssets` have passed a validity check. However, the code does not utilize this field in a meaningful way, as the conditional statement `if (!props.isValid) return 0;` is not executed due to the constant truth value of `isValid`.\n\nIn essence, the `isValid` field is redundant and can be safely removed, as its presence does not provide any additional functionality or security benefits."
284,"There is a vulnerability in the code. An attacker can manipulate the `member.validator.unbonded.count` by +1. This can be exploited by sending a transaction that increases the `withdrawalBlock` value to a high number, causing the `_finalise` function to be called multiple times. This will increment the `node.minipools.finalised.count` and `minipools.finalised.count` by one, reducing the `eth.matched.node.amount` by one to many times. Eventually, the `decrementMemberUnbondedValidatorCount` function will be called, which will decrement the `member.validator.unbonded.count` by 1, but because the `withdrawalBlock` value is set to a high number, the function will be called multiple times, incrementing the `member.validator.unbonded.count` by +1 each time. This can be used to manipulate the validator count and potentially gain control over the node.","The vulnerability in the RocketMinipoolDelegateOld contract allows a node operator to manipulate accounting by reentering the `finalise()` function. This is achieved by calling `finalise()` to finalize a Minipool, which triggers a call to `_refund()` to send a refund balance to the `nodeWithdrawalAddress`. However, the `_refund()` function does not check if the `finalised` flag is set, allowing the node operator to reenter the `finalise()` function and manipulate the system settings.\n\nThe node operator can exploit this vulnerability by calling `finalise()` repeatedly, increasing the `node.minipools.finalised.count` and `minipools.finalised.count` variables, and reducing the `eth.matched.node.amount` value. This can have a significant impact on the system, as it affects the calculation of `getNodeETHCollateralisationRatio`, `getNodeETHProvided`, and `getNodeMaximumRPLStake`.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly concerning because it allows the node operator to manipulate the system settings without being detected. The `finalise()` function is not protected against reentrancy, and the `finalised` flag is only set at the very end of the function, making it possible for the node operator to reenter the function and manipulate the system settings.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited by a node operator who has control over the `nodeWithdrawalAddress` and has the ability to call the `finalise()` function repeatedly."
285,"There is no vulnerability in the first codeblock. It defines some constants related to the minimum and maximum voting periods and delays.\n\nIn the second codeblock, there is a vulnerability. The ""Berachain"" contract has a property that specifies the block time as 5 seconds. This is a potential security vulnerability because it allows for fast block times, which can be exploited by attackers. An attacker could potentially mine a block before the previous block has been confirmed, which could lead to double-spending or other types of attacks.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could potentially mine a block faster than the specified block time, which could lead to double-spending or other types of attacks.","The `Goldigovernor` smart contract contains a vulnerability due to an incorrect assumption about the block time. Specifically, the contract's voting period and delay limits are set based on a block time of 15 seconds, as indicated by the constants `MIN_VOTING_PERIOD`, `MAX_VOTING_PERIOD`, `MIN_VOTING_DELAY`, and `MAX_VOTING_DELAY`. However, the Berachain network, which this contract is deployed on, has a block time of only 5 seconds, as documented.\n\nThis discrepancy between the expected and actual block time can lead to unintended consequences, as the voting period and delay limits will be set shorter than intended. This may result in unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in the contract's voting mechanism."
286,"There is no vulnerability in the first codeblock. The function `contribute` checks the state of the contract and the type of contribution token, and then verifies the value of the contribution. The `nonReentrant` modifier ensures that the function cannot be called multiple times in a row, and the `auth` function checks that the caller has the `CONTRIBUTE_ROLE`.\n\nIn the second codeblock, there is a vulnerability. The `require` statement checks if the `_token` is an instance of the `ERC20` contract and then checks if the `_to` and `_amount` variables are set. If either of these checks fails, the `require` statement will revert the transaction. However, if the `_token` is not an instance of the `ERC20` contract, or if the `_to` or `_amount` variables are not set, the `require` statement will not revert the transaction, but it will still execute the `ERROR_TOKEN_TRANSFER_REVERTED` error message. This means that an attacker could set the `_token` variable to a non-ERC20 token, or set the `_to` or `_amount` variables to the zero address or zero value, respectively, and the transaction would still be executed, but the token transfer would fail and the error message would be displayed to the user.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could set the `_token` variable to a non-ERC20 token, or set the `_to` or `_amount` variables to the zero address or zero value, respectively, and then call the `contribute` function.

The `contributionToken` is stored as an `ERC20` contract type, which is then directly compared to the constant `ETH` (represented by `address(0x0)`). This comparison is problematic because it can lead to incorrect results and potential security issues.\n\nIn the `contribute` function, the `contributionToken` is checked against `ETH` using an `if` statement. However, this comparison is invalid because `contributionToken` is an `ERC20` contract type, not a specific address. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the comparison is done using the `==` operator, which is not suitable for comparing different data types.\n\nFurthermore, the `_transfer` function double casts the `token` to `ERC20` if it is the contribution `token`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities, as the casting operation can result in unintended consequences.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the `contributionToken` and potentially gain unauthorized access to the contract's functionality."
287,"Vulnerability: Double spend attack\n\nDescription:\nIn this code, the `wAmount` is calculated by comparing `wAmount` with `pos.underlyingAmount` and taking the maximum of the two. If `wAmount` is greater than `pos.underlyingAmount`, it sets `wAmount` to `pos.underlyingAmount`. This means that if an attacker has enough `wAmount` tokens and less `pos.underlyingAmount` tokens, they can manipulate the `wAmount` variable to spend the same amount of tokens twice.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a transaction that sends more `wAmount` tokens than the `pos.underlyingAmount` and less `wAmount` tokens than the `pos.underlyingAmount`. This would cause the `wAmount` variable to be set to the `pos.underlyingAmount` value, allowing the attacker to spend the same amount of tokens twice.","The interest component of the underlying amount is permanently locked in the BlueBerryBank contract, rendering it irretrievable. This occurs when a user attempts to withdraw their underlying amount using the `withdrawLend` function, which caps the withdrawable amount to the initial underlying deposited by the user (`pos.underlyingAmount`). This means that a user can burn all their vault shares and only receive their original underlying deposit.\n\nThe interest accrued component, which rightfully belongs to the user, is lost forever because the underlying vault shares are already burnt. The `withdrawLend` function in the BlueBerryBank contract allows users to withdraw their underlying amount from either `Hard` or `Soft` vaults, which are backed by interest-bearing `cTokens` issued by the Compound Protocol.\n\nWhen a user attempts to withdraw the maximum `shareAmount` to retrieve all their lent amount, the `withdrawLend` function limits the withdrawable amount to `pos.underlyingAmount`, which is the original deposit made by the user. Notably, the full `shareAmount` is deducted from `underlyingVaultShare`, leaving the user with no remaining vault shares against their address. The interest accrued component on the underlying amount, which was returned by the `SoftVault` to the BlueBerryBank, never makes it back to the original lender."

The function uniswapV3SwapCallback() is called when the swap is completed. The function checks if the caller is the Uniswap V3 pool and then performs the swap. However, the function also allows any address to call the function and perform the swap.

The contract then repays the borrow token loan to the Compound fork and validates that the user's position is still within the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\n\nThe issue lies in the `uniswapV3SwapCallback` function, which does not enforce any additional checks and simply sends the requested delta directly to Uniswap. This allows malicious actors to identify and manipulate the trade, exploiting the lack of slippage protection. The `amountRepay` parameter, which is inputted by the user, is insufficient to protect users, as many users will want to make only a small repayment or no repayment at all, leaving the contract vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nA malicious MEV bot can identify these transactions in the mempool, execute a sandwich attack by trading massively in the same direction as the trade in advance, and then trading back after the `IchiVaultSpell` contract, pocketing a profit at the user's expense."
289,"There is a vulnerability in the `_addLiquidity` function. The function calculates the optimal amounts of tokens A and B to add to the liquidity pool based on the desired amounts and minimum amounts provided.

However, the attacker could then call the function again with the correct minimum amount, allowing them to add the desired amount of the token to the liquidity pool.\n\nFor example, if the minimum amount of token A is 100 and the user tries to add 99 of token A, the function would revert with an error message. However, the attacker could then call the function again with 100 of token A, allowing them to add the desired amount of token A to the liquidity pool.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call the `_addLiquidity` function multiple times, each time with less than the minimum amount of a token, and then call it again with the correct minimum amount to add the desired amount of the token to the liquidity pool.","The protocol lacks a crucial deadline check in its deposit-withdraw-trade transaction logic, which can lead to unintended consequences. Specifically, the `addLiquidity` function does not verify whether the transaction is still valid before executing it. This oversight can result in expired transactions being executed, potentially causing issues with the protocol's functionality and user experience.\n\nIn the provided code, the `ensure` modifier is used to implement a deadline check, which ensures that the transaction is executed within a specified timeframe. However, this check is not present in the `addLiquidity` function, leaving the transaction vulnerable to being executed after its deadline has passed.\n\nThe absence of this deadline check can lead to a situation where a user initiates a transaction, but the protocol fails to execute it due to the transaction being expired.

290,"Vulnerability description:\nThe code is vulnerable to integer overflow.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a transaction that causes the `tokenDecimal` variable to be set to a value that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256. For example, if `tokenDecimal` is set to 20, the code will attempt to perform the division by 10 to the power of 20, which will result in an overflow and an incorrect value being stored in the `bidDownPrice`, `bidUpPrice`, `askDownPrice`, and `askUpPrice` variables. This could potentially lead to incorrect pricing and loss of funds for the contract.","The `parseAllPrice` function in the DODOv3 protocol is unable to process tokens with a decimal precision greater than 18. This limitation is due to the fact that the function is not designed to accommodate tokens with a higher number of decimal places, such as NEAR, which has 24 decimal places. As a result, users are unable to trade tokens with a decimal precision greater than 18, which is a significant limitation given that the protocol is intended to be compatible with all standard ERC20 tokens.\n\nThe issue arises when the `tokenDecimal` variable exceeds 18, causing the calculation of `fixDecimal` to result in a value that would revert the entire operation. This is because the `18 - tokenDecimal` calculation would produce a value that is too large to be handled by the function, leading to a reversion.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the function attempts to adjust the prices by dividing or multiplying them by a factor that is calculated as `10 ** fixDecimal`.

This can result in a situation where the borrower or lender is unable to access their collateral assets, leading to potential financial losses.\n\nThe issue arises because the `CollateralManager#_withdraw()` function uses a for-loop to iterate over the `_collateralInfo` array, which can cause the transaction to reach the gas limit if the array contains a large number of collateral assets. This can lead to the transaction being reverted, preventing the withdrawal or liquidation of the collateral assets.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a mechanism to limit the number of collateral assets that can be assigned to the `_collateralInfo` array, such as by setting a maximum limit on the number of collateral assets that can be assigned."
293,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nThe vulnerability arises from the use of the `emit` statement in the constructor.

However, this constant is fixed and cannot be changed, which can lead to issues if the slippage exceeds the allowed threshold.\n\nIn the `_swapFarmEmissionTokens` function, the contract checks if the slippage is within the allowed limit by comparing the calculated `amountOutMin` with the `MAX_SLIPPAGE` constant. If the slippage is not satisfied, the entire transaction reverts. This means that if the slippage exceeds the allowed limit, the harvesting of the strategy will be stuck, as the transaction will fail and the strategy will not be able to harvest the accumulated BOO tokens.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the slippage by sandwich-attacking the `harvest()` function, which can lead to a large accumulation of BOO tokens.

This modification can have unintended consequences, particularly when a user has already proposed a proposal and has insufficient voting power to cancel it.\n\nThe issue is that the `cancel()` function relies on the `proposalThreshold` value at the time of proposal submission, rather than the current value. This means that even if the `proposalThreshold` is increased after the proposal is submitted, the user's voting power may no longer be sufficient to cancel the proposal. In the given scenario, the user initially had 100 voting power, which was sufficient to propose the proposal when `proposalThreshold` was 100. However, when `proposalThreshold` is increased to 150, the user's voting power becomes insufficient to cancel the proposal, effectively rendering the `cancel()` function ineffective.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of considering the dynamic nature of proposal thresholds and ensuring that proposal cancellation mechanisms take into account the current threshold value, rather than the value at the time of proposal submission."
301,"There is a vulnerability in the `escape` function. The function modifies the `gameInfo.activeAgents` and `gameInfo.escapedAgents` state variables, but it does not update the `gameInfo.activeAgents` variable after the `for` loop. This can cause a reentrancy vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `escape` function multiple times in quick succession. Each call to the `escape` function will increase the `activeAgentsAfterEscape` variable by the number of agentIds provided in the call. However, since the `activeAgents` variable is not updated after the `for` loop, the `activeAgents` variable will still be equal to the value it had before the `for` loop.\n\nIf the attacker calls the `escape` function multiple times in quick succession, the `activeAgents` variable will never be updated, and the `_assertGameIsNotOverAfterEscape` function will always return true. This will allow the attacker to escape multiple times, even if the game is not over.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `activeAgents` variable should be updated after the `for` loop. For example, the following line should be added after the `for` loop:\n```\ngameInfo.activeAgents = uint16(activeAgentsAfterEscape);\n```\nThis will ensure that the `activeAgents` variable is always updated correctly, and the reentrancy vulnerability will be fixed.","The vulnerability arises when agents have the opportunity to either `escape` or `heal` before the `_requestForRandomness` function is called, and the order of execution between these two functions is not specified. This ambiguity can lead to unfair outcomes in the game, particularly when there are only a few active agents remaining.\n\nThe `heal` function requires that the number of active agents is greater than `NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS`, but the `escape` function can reduce the count of active agents. If the `escape` function is executed first and the number of active agents becomes equal to or less than `NUMBER_OF_SECONDARY_PRIZE_POOL_WINNERS`, the `heal` function will be disabled, effectively killing the wounded agents.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the order of execution between `escape` and `heal` to achieve an unfair advantage. For instance, if an agent wants to escape and 10 wounded agents want to heal, the outcome can be drastically different depending on whether `escape` or `heal` is executed first. This can lead to an unfair distribution of rewards and prizes in the game.\n\nIn the example provided, if `escape` is executed first, all wounded agents will be killed, resulting in a different outcome compared to when `heal` is executed first, which would save 5 agents. This demonstrates how the ambiguity in the order of execution can lead to unfair outcomes, compromising the integrity of the game."

The functions used in the code are also well-defined and follow the standard Solidity conventions.\n\nThe attacking vector for this code is not clear as there is no obvious vulnerability that an attacker could exploit. The code checks for the correct input and performs the necessary calculations to determine the swap result. It also uses the `IERC20Token` interface to interact with the price oracle, which is a standard interface in the ERC20 token standard.\n\nOverall, the code seems to be secure and there is no vulnerability in it.","The vulnerability lies in the way the system treats the USD1 token. Specifically, it is priced as $1 instead of being pegged to USDT, which allows for arbitrage opportunities. This discrepancy in pricing enables users to exploit the system by swapping USD1 for USDT at an inflated rate, effectively creating a profit.\n\nThe issue arises when calculating the swap result, where the system uses the price of the quote token (USDT) to determine the amount of the quote token to be received. In this case, the price is set to 0.99e18, indicating that 1 USDT is worth $0.99. However, this is not the correct pegged value of USD1, which is supposed to be pegged to USDT.\n\nAs a result, when swapping 1 USD1 for USDT, the system calculates the amount of USDT to be received as 0.99e6, which is less than the expected value. Conversely, when swapping USDT for USD1, the system calculates the amount of USD1 to be received as 1.01e18, which is more than the expected value.\n\nThis vulnerability allows users to exploit the system by swapping USD1 for USDT at an inflated rate, effectively creating a profit. The profit is taken from other users of the protocol who deposited USDT to access the other stablecoins."

Additionally, there is a vulnerability in the `recoveredFunds` variable calculation in the `transferFrom` function, which could lead to an incorrect value being used.","The `AgentPolice.distributeLiquidatedFunds()` function is responsible for redistributing funds to pools after an agent is liquidated. The function is designed to transfer assets from the liquidator to the pool, with the intention of redeeming as many funds as possible. However, a critical issue arises when the pool's debt is greater than the amount of funds available for distribution. In this scenario, the pool will only transfer the amount of funds needed to settle the debt, leaving any residual funds unaccounted for.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that the pool's debt is not fully satisfied, resulting in a discrepancy between the total debt and the amount of funds transferred. This can lead to a situation where residual funds remain stuck in the `AgentPolice` contract, rather than being properly distributed to the pools."
306,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription:\nIn the Solidity code, the `_extraData` parameter is being used to determine the function signature of the external call being made. However, the code does not properly check if the external call is being made to the correct function.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the `_extraData` parameter to make the code believe that it is calling the `tbtcToBtc` function, when in reality, it is calling the `unqualifiedDepositToTbtc` function. This allows the attacker to bypass the reentrancy protection and steal funds from the contract.\n\nFor example, an attacker could call the `tbtcToBtc` function and then immediately call the `transfer` function to send the BTC to an external address. The contract would then call the `tbtcToBtc` function again, but since the `_extraData` parameter is being manipulated, it would actually call the `unqualifiedDepositToTbtc` function instead. This would allow the attacker to steal the BTC that was sent to the contract.","The `FundingScript` and `RedemptionScript` in the provided code utilize the `mload` instruction to cast the initial bytes of a byte array to a `bytes4` value. This operation is performed to extract the function signature from the `_extraData` variable. However, since `mload` operates on 32-byte chunks, the resulting `bytes4` value may contain dirty lower-order bits.\n\nIn the `FundingScript.receiveApproval` and `RedemptionScript.receiveApproval` functions, the extracted function signature is compared with the expected selector values for `vendingMachine.unqualifiedDepositToTbtc` and `vendingMachine.tbtcToBtc`, respectively.

The vulnerability lies in the `joinRequest` and `swapRequest` variables, which are not properly initialized before being used.\n\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by modifying the `swapRequest` variable to point to a malicious pool ID. This would cause the function to attempt to swap tokens in a pool that does not exist, resulting in a re-entrancy attack.\n\nThe attacker would send a transaction to call the `testAttack()` function, which would then attempt to swap tokens in a non-existent pool. The attacker could then send a second transaction to call the `testAttack()` function again, which would then attempt to swap tokens in the malicious pool. This would cause the function to repeatedly call itself, draining the attacker's balance.\n\nTherefore, the vulnerability is an improper initialization of variables, which can lead to a re-entrancy attack.","The `checkReentrancy` function in the `BalancerUtilities.sol` contract is designed to detect reentrancy attacks by performing a `staticcall` on the pool contract. However, due to incorrect usage of `staticcall`, the function inadvertently burns up all the gas allocated for the call. This is because `staticcall` encounters a state change, which causes it to burn up the entire gas allocation, as per the Solidity documentation.\n\nThe issue is further exacerbated by the fact that the `checkReentrancy` function attempts to call the `manageUserBalance` function on the vault contract, which also results in a state change. This state change is detected by the `staticcall`, leading to the gas being burned up.\n\nThe problem is highlighted in the balancer monorepo, which provides guidelines on how to correctly check for reentrancy.

The attacker can also manipulate the `GMXTypes.AddLiquidityParams` struct before it is passed to the `GMXManager.addLiquidity` function.\n\nThe attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by draining the contract's funds by transferring the contract's tokens to an address controlled by the attacker. The attacker can also manipulate the contract's status to make it appear as if the contract has failed, which can cause panic selling of the contract's tokens.","The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of compound cancellation, which leads to the contract becoming stuck in a `compound_failed` status. This occurs when the `compound` function is invoked by the keeper to swap a token held by the contract for TokenA or TokenB and add it as liquidity to `GMX`. \n\nInitially, the `compound` function exchanges the token for either tokenA or tokenB and sets the status to `compound`. Then, it adds the swapped token as liquidity to `GMX` by creating a deposit. However, if the deposit is cancelled, the `processCompoundCancellation` function is called, which sets the status to `compound_failed`. \n\nThe issue arises when the deposit is cancelled and the status becomes `compound_failed`. In this scenario, only the `compound` function can be called again, but the tokens have already been swapped for TokenA or TokenB. Consequently, the `amountIn` will be zero, and the compound logic will be skipped. As a result, the status remains `compound_failed`, leading to a deadlock.

This results in a mismatch between the actual number of modules and the `enabledModuleCount` variable.\n\nThis discrepancy can have severe consequences, as it can cause all future transactions to revert. When a transaction is executed, the `checkTransaction` function retrieves the hash of the first six modules using the `getModulesPaginated` function with the `enabledModuleCount` variable.

This discrepancy arises from the failure to account for the gas usage of the ""relayMessage"" wrapper, which increases the size of the message. As a result, the actual gas consumption of sending a message is higher than expected, causing users to pay less for gas on L1 and potentially leading to L2 blocks being filled earlier than anticipated.\n\nThe CrossDomainMessenger's `sendMessage` function is responsible for sending cross-chain messages, requiring users to specify the `_minGasLimit` argument, which represents the expected gas consumption of the message on the other chain. The function also calculates the gas required to pass the message to the other chain using the `baseGas` function, which computes the byte-wise cost of the message. However, this calculation only accounts for the original message, excluding the wrapped `relayMessage` call.\n\nThis discrepancy is particularly significant when considering the intrinsic gas calculation in `op-geth`, which calculates the gas consumption of an entire message data. The `baseGas` function in `CrossDomainMessenger` contradicts this calculation, leading to a mismatch between the contract's gas consumption and the node's gas consumption.\n\nFurthermore, this behavior also conflicts with the migration process, where the gas limit of migrated messages is computed on the entire `data`, including the `relayMessage` calldata. Given the logic of paying cross-chain messages' gas consumption on L1, it appears that the implementation in the migration code is correct, and the implementation in `CrossDomainMessenger` is incorrect.

342,"Vulnerability: Reentrancy vulnerability\n\nDescription: The vulnerability lies in the `deposit` function, specifically in the `IERC20.safeTransferFrom` call. An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `deposit` function multiple times in quick succession, each time providing a different token address.\n\nAttacking vector: The attacker can exploit the reentrancy vulnerability by calling the `deposit` function multiple times, each time providing a different token address. The function will first check if the token address is not 0x0, and if it is not, it will call the `IERC20.safeTransferFrom` function to transfer the token from the attacker's address to the contract's address. However, since the function does not check if the token address is 0x0 before calling `IERC20.safeTransferFrom`, the contract will not be able to detect that the attacker is transferring the same token back to themselves, and the attacker will be able to drain the contract's funds.","The `deposit()` function in the `DepositVault` contract is designed to allow users to deposit either Ether (ETH) or a specified ERC20 token. However, the implementation has a critical flaw when dealing with non-standard ERC20 tokens, particularly those that incur fees on transfer or rebalance their token balances.\n\nThe issue arises when the `deposit()` function assumes that the `amount` of tokens transferred is equal to the `amount` provided by the user. This assumption is not valid for non-standard ERC20 tokens, which may transfer a different amount of tokens due to fees or rebalancing mechanisms. For instance, fee-on-transfer tokens may deduct a fee from the transferred amount, resulting in a discrepancy between the expected and actual token balance.\n\nIn the case of rebalancing tokens, the token balance may be adjusted during the transfer process, leading to an incorrect `amount` being recorded in the `deposits` array. Since the `deposit()` function only allows for full withdrawal, this means that the tokens will be permanently locked in the contract, rendering them inaccessible to the user.\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of considering the nuances of non-standard ERC20 tokens when designing smart contract functionality, particularly when dealing with token transfers and balances."

This is because the Notional-side does not verify that all secondary debts have been cleared (i.e., set to zero) before trusting that the StrategyVault-side has handled them properly.\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that the `borrowSecondaryCurrencyToVault` and `repaySecondaryCurrencyToVault` methods allow vaults to borrow and repay secondary currency, but the Notional-side does not ensure that this process is completed during a full exit. As a result, the secondary debt may remain outstanding, leaving the protocol with bad debt.\n\nThe code snippet at line 271 demonstrates this vulnerability, as it only validates the primary debt but neglects to check the secondary debt during a full exit.

The attacker can then call the `balanceOf` function on the SushiBar contract to obtain a very small share of the Sushi supply. The attacker can then call the `balanceOfToken` function on the `balanceOf` function's return value, which will result in an infinite user balance.\n\nThere is no vulnerability.","The `balanceOfToken` function in the provided code calculates the total balance of asset tokens for a given address, taking into account both deposits and interest. However, the computation is overly conservative, potentially underestimating the actual balance. This is because it uses a two-step process to determine the amount of SUSHI tokens that ""belong"" to the yield source contract, which is not a realistic scenario.\n\nIn reality, the actual balance of SUSHI tokens for an address is more accurately computed by directly multiplying the balance of SUSHI tokens in the `SushiBar` contract by the number of shares held by that address, and then dividing by the total supply of shares. This approach eliminates the need for the intermediate step of calculating the total SUSHI balance that ""belongs"" to the yield source contract.\n\nThe issue arises because the `balanceOfToken` function is designed to return the total balance of SUSHI tokens that an address could potentially withdraw from the `SushiBar` contract, based on their shareholding.

The attacker can then use these manipulated values to perform malicious actions on the blockchain.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the use of constant variables without any checks to ensure that they are not modified. In Solidity, constant variables are meant to be used as read-only values and should not be modified.

For example, the contract could use the ""view"" keyword to indicate that the values of the constants are read-only and should not be modified. Alternatively, the contract could use the ""pure"" keyword to indicate that the values of the constants are not affected by the contract's state and should not be modified.","The No Proper Trusted Setup vulnerability affects the security of the Plonk proof system, which relies on a preprocessed Common Reference String (CRS) for proving and verification.

371,"There is a vulnerability in the code. The attacking vector is through a re-entrancy attack.\n\nDescription:\nThe function `buyCollateralFromAuction` transfers VUSD from the contract to the buyer and then transfers the collateral token from the contract to the buyer. If the balance of the collateral token in the contract is zero after the transfer, the function sets the `startedAt` and `expiryTime` fields of the auction struct to zero.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `buyCollateralFromAuction` function multiple times in quick succession. The attacker will first call the function to transfer VUSD to the contract, and then immediately call the function again to transfer the collateral token from the contract to the attacker's address. This will cause the `startedAt` and `expiryTime` fields of the auction struct to be set to zero, and the attacker will receive the collateral token for free.\n\nTo prevent this vulnerability, the function should check the balance of the collateral token before transferring it to the buyer, and only transfer it if the balance is greater than zero. Additionally, the function should not set the `startedAt` and `expiryTime` fields of the auction struct to zero if the balance of the collateral token is zero.","The vulnerability lies in the `buyCollateralFromAuction` function, specifically in the condition that checks whether to close the auction. The function only terminates the auction when the balance of the token being auctioned reaches zero. This can be exploited by malicious users to extend the auction and acquire the collateral at a significantly discounted price.\n\nOne method to achieve this is by donating or leaving a small amount of dust (e.g., 1 wei) in the contract, effectively preventing the auction from closing. Since the gas costs associated with buying the remaining collateral would be higher than the value of the dust, it is unlikely that anyone would purchase the remaining collateral, allowing the malicious user to continue bidding and acquiring the collateral at a lower price.\n\nAnother approach is to use a frontrunning technique, where a malicious user sends a single wei transfer to the contract, effectively extending the auction. This would also prevent the auction from closing, allowing the malicious user to continue bidding and acquiring the collateral at a lower price.\n\nAs a result, the insurance fund would suffer losses due to the extended auction, as the collateral is sold at a significantly discounted price."

However, this hardcoded address is not the correct mainnet address, which poses a significant risk.\n\nWhen the `AutoRoller` attempts to call the `cooldown` method, it will inevitably fail due to the incorrect Divider address. This failure will cause the `getNewTargetedRate` method to revert, resulting in the inability to complete the AutoRoller cycle. As a consequence, liquidity providers (LPs) will be forced to either withdraw or eject their liquidity. Withdrawal is only possible up to a certain point, after which the eject mechanism becomes the only means for LPs to recover their funds.

This means that the comparison will always be outdated, as the block.number will always be greater than the actual number of blocks that have been mined since the operator packed their params.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the block.number value.

In this scenario, the `getUndelegationBlock()` method returns a value that is not valid, causing the `require` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

377,"There is a vulnerability in the Solidity code.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can manipulate the `totalEarnUSDCBalance` variable to cause a division by zero.\n\nExplanation: In the `getIndex` function, the `totalEarnUSDCBalance` variable is checked to see if it is zero. If it is, the function returns a very large number (1e18). However, if it is not zero, the function uses the `SignedDecimalMath.decimalDiv` function to divide `getNetValue` by `totalEarnUSDCBalance`. If an attacker can manipulate the `totalEarnUSDCBalance` variable to be zero, they can cause a division by zero error in the `getIndex` function. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by depositing a large amount of USDC and causing the contract to crash or return incorrect results.","The FundRateArbitrage contract is vulnerable to inflation attacks, which can be exploited by manipulating the index calculation. The index is calculated by dividing the net value of the contract, including USDC held, by the current supply of totalEarnUSDCBalance. This calculation can be inflated by depositing and donating a large amount of USDC, effectively increasing the totalEarnUSDCBalance. \n\nWhen a user deposits a share, their deposit can be taken almost completely via rounding, as the earnUSDCAmount is calculated by dividing the deposit amount by the inflated index. This can lead to a situation where any deposit under a certain threshold (in this case, 100,000e6 USDC) will result in zero shares being allocated, effectively rendering the deposit useless.

For example, if the oracleData.currentExternalUnderlyingLend variable is set to a negative value, the offTargetPercentage variable will always return a positive value, even if the targetAmount variable is greater than the oracleData.currentExternalUnderlyingLend variable. This could allow the attacker to trick the code into thinking that the lending position is not at risk, when in fact it is.","The `_isExternalLendingUnhealthy` function in the `TreasuryAction.sol` contract calculates the off-target percentage as a ratio of the difference between the current external lending amount and the target amount to the sum of the current external lending amount and the target amount. This calculation is incorrect and may lead to a rebalancing being skipped even when the external lending is unhealthy.\n\nThe off-target percentage is calculated as the absolute difference between the current external lending amount and the target amount, divided by the sum of the current external lending amount and the target amount, and then multiplied by 100%. This formula is incorrect and may result in an underestimation of the off-target percentage.\n\nFor example, if the target amount is 100 and the current external lending amount is 90, the off-target percentage would be calculated as 10 / (100 + 90) = 0.0526 = 5.26%, which is incorrect. The correct calculation would be 10 / 100 = 0.1 = 10%.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the off-target percentage as a ratio of the difference to the target amount, which is `offTargetPercentage = abs(currentExternalUnderlyingLend - targetAmount) / targetAmount * 100%`.

However, the fallback function is not protected by this modifier, which means that any contract can call the fallback function without any restrictions.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker can call the fallback function of another contract, which will execute the fallback function of the vulnerable contract.

However, the introduction of EIP 3074, which introduces the `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL` instructions, poses a challenge to this approach.\n\nThe `AUTH` instruction allows a smart contract to delegate control of an EOA to itself, effectively bypassing the `tx.origin` check. This means that even if a smart contract is authorized to act on behalf of an EOA, it can still use the `onlyEOAEx` modifier to make calls, which would be misinterpreted as coming from the EOA itself.

This could result in the code returning the wrong value for the `hintId` or not returning a value at all.\n\nFor example, if the `orderHintArray` has 5 elements, the code would expect to iterate 4 times. However, if the attacker adds a 0th element to the `orderHintArray` before the loop, the code would iterate 5 times and return `Constants.HEAD` instead of the correct `hintId`.","The vulnerability lies in the `findOrderHintId` function, which relies on the assumption that when a previous order's type is `matched`, it must have been at the top of the orderbook.

One way to do this is to add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the `_mintingBeneficiary` variable has not been updated within a certain time frame (e.g. 1 second) before allowing the function to proceed.",
387,"Vulnerability: Possible reentrancy vulnerability in the `_claim` function.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could call the `_claim` function multiple times in quick succession, exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability to steal more tokens.\n\nExplanation: The `_claim` function is called in the `if (s.share, left) = _claim(s);` line, which means that the function is called recursively. If an attacker can call the `_claim` function multiple times in quick succession, they can exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to steal more tokens. For example, an attacker could call the `_claim` function, transfer some of the claimed tokens to themselves, and then call the function again to claim more tokens. The stolen tokens would then be sent to the attacker's address.","The tax refund calculation logic in the provided code is flawed, leading to incorrect tax refunds being issued to users. Specifically, when the user's share of the token sale (s.share) exceeds the maximum tax-free allocation (taxFreeAllc), the refund tax amount is calculated incorrectly.\n\nThe issue arises when the code only considers the tax on the unused USDC amount (s.left) and neglects to account for the tax on the tax-free allocation. This results in users not receiving the full tax refund they are entitled to.\n\nFor instance, consider a user who deposits 1000 USDC and only half of their funds are used in the token sale (s.share = 500 USDC, s.left = 500 USDC). If the user has a tax-free allocation of 400 USDC, they should be refunded the tax on the unused USDC (500 USDC) as well as the tax on their tax-free allocation (400 USDC). However, the current implementation only refunds the tax on the unused USDC, leaving the user shortchanged.\n\nThis vulnerability can have significant financial implications for users, as they may not receive the full tax refund they are entitled to."

These functions are intended to be used for making state changes, but their implementation in the `StrategyBase` contract is problematic.\n\nThe `underlyingToShares` function in `StrategyBase` is declared as `view`, which means it cannot be overridden in derived contracts without the `view` modifier. This is because the `view` modifier is inherited from the `IStrategy` interface, which declares `underlyingToShares` as a `view` function. Similarly, the `sharesToUnderlying` function in `StrategyBase` is also declared as `view`, which means it cannot be overridden in derived contracts without the `view` modifier.\n\nFurthermore, the `initialize` function in the `StrategyBase` contract is not declared as `virtual`, which means it cannot be overridden in derived contracts. Additionally, the `initializer` modifier is used in the `initialize` function, which is not available in concrete strategies inherited from `StrategyBase`.

Then, immediately after the `openKeep` function is executed, the attacker could call `requestNewKeep(11, 20, 100)` to open another keep with a minimum value of 11 and a maximum value of 20. This would cause the contract to execute the `openKeep` function again, potentially leading to a reentrancy attack.","The `TBTCSystem.requestNewKeep` function, used by each new `Deposit` contract upon creation, lacks access controls, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Furthermore, `openKeep` automatically allocates bonds from members registered to the application, which is the tbtc system itself.\n\nThe `requestNewKeep` function has no access controls, allowing anyone to request the creation of a new keep with themselves as the ""owner"" and arbitrary signing threshold values. This means that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain control of a keep, seize signer bonds, close the keep, and potentially cause harm to group members.\n\nThe `requestNewKeep` function's lack of access controls allows an attacker to manipulate the keep's ownership and signing threshold, giving them the ability to exert control over the keep and its members.

If the attacker controls the `barSushiBalance` value, they can manipulate the `requiredShares` value and redeem more sushi than they should.\n\nFor example, if the attacker controls the `barSushiBalance` value to be 100 sushi, and they call the `redeemToken` function with an amount of 1000 sushi, the `requiredShares` value would be calculated as 1000000 / 100 = 10000.

The function takes an amount of SUSHI as input and calculates the corresponding amount of xSUSHI to be burned in exchange for the requested SUSHI.

The current implementation of `redeemToken` calls `leave` with a calculated value of xSUSHI, which results in a floor value of SUSHI that is less than or equal to the requested amount. However, this may not be the optimal or correct value, as it does not guarantee the redemption of the exact requested amount.\n\nA more accurate calculation would involve finding the maximum value of xSUSHI that satisfies the condition `floor(x * b / a) <= y`, where `a` is the total supply of xSUSHI and `b` is the SushiBar's balance of SUSHI. This would result in a more precise redemption of the requested SUSHI amount. The difference between the actual and optimal redemption amounts is at most `floor(b / a)`, which may still be significant in certain scenarios."

However, this can lead to a potential reentrancy vulnerability if the `transferFrom` function is called again before the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function is executed.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `transferFrom` function multiple times before the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function is executed. This will cause the `transferFrom` function to be called again, allowing the attacker to manipulate the `require` statement in the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function, allowing them to bypass the token locking requirement and burn the tokens without any restrictions.\n\nVulnerability description:\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function, which calculates the locked amount for a given address. The function uses the `_balances[from]` variable to get the balance of the sender's address. However, this can lead to a potential reentrancy vulnerability if the `_balances[from]` variable is updated before the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function is executed.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `_balances[from]` variable multiple times before the `_getAndUpdateLockedAmount` function is","This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the re-entrancy feature in the token burning mechanism, enabling them to burn delegated tokens without being detected. The issue arises from the placement of the `_callTokensToSend` function, which is called after the check for unlocked tokens but before the actual token burning process.\n\nThe attacker can take advantage of this timing vulnerability by delegating tokens to themselves immediately after the check, effectively bypassing the requirement for unlocked tokens. This allows them to burn the delegated tokens without triggering the ""Token should be unlocked for burning"" error, as the `_balances[from]` balance is updated before the actual burning occurs.\n\nThe attacker can repeatedly delegate and burn tokens, effectively draining the `_balances[from]` balance without being detected, as the `_totalSupply` and `_balances[from]` variables are updated before the burning process is completed. This re-entrancy attack enables the attacker to manipulate the token supply and balances, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers and supply manipulation."
411,"Vulnerability:\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the use of the `unwrap()` function in the code. This function is used to handle the case where the result of a calculation is zero or negative. However, it is not designed to handle the case where the result is zero or positive.\n\nAttacking vector:\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a transaction with a value of zero or a negative value to the contract. This would cause the `unwrap()` function to be called, and the contract would revert with an error message. However, if the attacker sends a transaction with a value of zero or a positive value, the `unwrap()` function would not be called, and the attacker would be able to receive the wrapped Ether without paying any gas fees.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the second codeblock.","The `swETH::_deposit` function contains a vulnerability due to an unnecessary hidden division operation before multiplication. Specifically, the `_ethToSwETHRate` function is called, which performs a division operation, and the result is then multiplied by the `msg.value`. This division operation is not explicitly visible in the original code, making it a hidden division.\n\nThe issue is present in the mainnet code and has not been introduced by recent changes. The problematic code block can be expanded to reveal the hidden division, as shown below:\n```\nswETHAmount = wrap(msg.value).mul(_ethToSwETHRate()).unwrap();\n// Equivalent to:\nswETHAmount = wrap(msg.value).mul(wrap(1 ether).div(_swETHToETHRate())).unwrap();\n```\nThis vulnerability can have significant implications for the security and accuracy of the `swETH::_deposit` function, as it can lead to precision loss and potentially incorrect calculations."

This can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `wrap` function is called multiple times.\n\nIn each case, an attacker can take advantage of the reentrancy vulnerability by calling the `_approve` or `_approveBalancerTokens` function multiple times, causing the `approve` or `checkApprove` function to be called multiple times, and eventually causing an overflow or reentrancy attack.","The vulnerability ""Did Not Approve To Zero First"" occurs when the allowance is not set to zero before changing it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or reverts when interacting with certain ERC20 tokens, such as USDT. This is because some ERC20 tokens, like USDT, do not allow changing the allowance from a non-zero value to a new value, as a protection mechanism against front-running changes of approvals.\n\nIn the provided code, the `checkApprove` function is used extensively throughout the protocol, particularly in the `TokenUtils`, `TwoTokenPoolUtils`, `Boosted3TokenPoolUtils`, `TradingUtils`, and `StrategyUtils` files. However, the function does not ensure that the allowance is set to zero before changing it, which can lead to issues when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value.\n\nFor example, in the `TokenUtils` file, the `checkApprove` function is called without setting the allowance to zero before changing it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or reverts when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value. Similarly, in the `TwoTokenPoolUtils` and `Boosted3TokenPoolUtils` files, the `checkApprove` function is called without setting the allowance to zero before changing it, which can also lead to issues when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value.\n\nIn the `TradingUtils` file, the `_approve` function is used to approve the exchange to pull from this contract, but it does not set the allowance to zero before changing it, which can lead to issues when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value. Similarly, in the `StrategyUtils` file, the `checkApprove` function is used to approve the buy token, but it does not set the allowance to zero before changing it, which can also lead to issues when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value.\n\nTo avoid this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the allowance to zero before changing it, especially when interacting with ERC20 tokens that do not support changing the allowance from a non-zero value."

The vulnerability is that the `tradingEnabled` variable is not being updated in a safe way.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `disableTrading` function with the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that only the contract owner can call this function. The attacker could then call the `disableTrading` function and set `tradingEnabled` to `false` without being the contract owner.

This function calculates the collateral ratio spot price using the incorrect style, which can lead to incorrect liquidation checks.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `getCollateralRatioSpotPrice_IncorrectStyle_As_In_Existing_DittoProtocol` function with the correct values of `oraclePrice` and `price`. If the calculated collateral ratio spot price is greater than or equal to the `primaryLiquidationCR`, the contract will return ""Errors.SufficientCollateral; can not be flagged"", even if the collateral ratio is actually less than the `primaryLiquidationCR`. This allows the attacker to avoid liquidation.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `getCollateralRatioSpotPrice_IncorrectStyle_As_In_Existing_DittoProtocol` function should be updated to use the correct style of collateral ratio spot price calculation, as shown in the `getCollateralRatioSpotPrice_CorrectStyle` function.","The vulnerability in the DittoETH protocol's collateral ratio calculation causes potential loss due to rounding-up. This occurs when the user's collateral ratio is calculated by dividing the collateral by the ERC-20 debt, multiplied by the oracle price, before multiplying the result by the oracle price. This division before multiplication can lead to loss of precision, resulting in incorrect calculations.\n\nThe issue arises in multiple places in the code, specifically in the `getCollateralRatioSpotPrice` function, which is called in various scenarios. The function calculates the collateral ratio as `short.collateral.div(short.ercDebt.mul(oraclePrice))`, which can lead to rounding-up due to the division before multiplication.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, let's consider an example. Suppose the collateral is 100 ether, the ERC-20 debt is 100,000 ether, and the oracle price is 0.0005 ether. The calculated collateral ratio would be `short.collateral.div(short.ercDebt.mul(oraclePrice))`, which would result in a value of approximately 0.0005 ether. However, due to the division before multiplication, the actual value would be rounded up to 0.0005 ether, causing the collateral ratio to be incorrectly calculated.\n\nThis vulnerability can have significant implications for the DittoETH protocol, as it can lead to incorrect calculations and potential losses for users. To mitigate this issue, it is essential to correct the calculation by multiplying the collateral by the oracle price before dividing by the ERC-20 debt, as shown in the correct calculation: `(short.collateral.mul(oracleD)).div(short.ercDebt.mul(oracleN))`."
416,"There is a vulnerability in the `OracleModule.sol` file.\n\nDescription:\nThe vulnerability lies in the `_getPrice` function, specifically in the line where the `offchainInvalid` variable is checked. If the `offchainInvalid` variable is `false`, the function will return the freshest price, regardless of whether it is from the on-chain or off-chain source. However, if the `offchainInvalid` variable is `true`, the function will return the price from the on-chain source. This means that if an attacker can manipulate the `offchainInvalid` variable to be `false`, they can force the function to return the price from the on-chain source, even if the off-chain source has a more recent and accurate price.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can manipulate the `offchainInvalid` variable to be `false` by sending a transaction that calls the `_getPrice` function with a `maxAge` value that is less than the current block timestamp. This would cause the function to return the on-chain price, which the attacker could then use to manipulate the price of the assets in the vault.\n\nVulnerability: Manipulation of the `offchainInvalid` variable to force the function to return the on-chain price, even if the off-chain source has a more recent and accurate price.","The Oracle will not failover as expected during liquidation, which can lead to underwater positions and bad debt accumulating in the protocol, threatening its solvency. This is due to the inability to update the Pyth price during liquidation, as the liquidators have the option to bypass the `updatePythPrice` modifier.\n\nWhen Pyth is down, the fallback mechanism within the FlatCoin protocol does not work as intended. As a result, the prices stored in the Pyth on-chain contract become outdated and stale. During liquidation, the `_getPrice` function is executed, which fetches the latest price from Chainlink and the last available price on the Pyth on-chain contract. When the Pyth on-chain prices have not been updated for a period of time, the deviation between the on-chain and off-chain prices widens, causing a revert at Line 113, blocking the liquidation from being carried out.\n\nThis issue arises because the protocol team's goal of allowing liquidators to execute a liquidation without updating the Pyth price to ensure that the liquidations will work regardless of Pyth's working status is not achieved. Instead, the liquidation mechanism within the FlatCoin protocol will stop working, leading to potential financial losses for the protocol."

418,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity code.,"The vulnerability lies in the design of the Transceiver upgrade mechanism, which allows integrators to bypass the checks that ensure the integrity of the NTT Manager's ownership and immutables during an upgrade. Specifically, the `Transceiver::_checkImmutables` function, which verifies that the NTT Manager address and the underlying NTT token address remain unchanged, can be overridden or bypassed by calling `Implementation::_setMigratesImmutables` with a `true` input.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who gains control of a Transceiver and upgrades it without the necessary checks, allowing them to change the NTT Manager's owner and potentially disrupt the expected ownership model. The `Transceiver` contract's `_initialize` function sets the owner of the Transceiver to the owner of the `NttManager` contract, and the `transferTransceiverOwnership` function allows the NTT Manager to update the Transceiver's owner. However, this process can be broken if the new owner of a Transceiver performs an upgrade without the immutables check, allowing them to change the NTT Manager's owner and potentially disrupt the expected ownership model.\n\nThe `NttManagerState::transferOwnership` function is designed to ensure that the NTT Manager's owner is kept in sync across all Transceivers, but this process can be broken if a Transceiver is upgraded without the necessary checks. As a result, the `NttManagerState::transferOwnership` function will revert if any one Transceiver is out of sync with the others, and manual updates will be required to restore the expected ownership model."

This functionality is problematic because it can be called even when the contract is already in the `SETTLING` phase, which may have unintended consequences.

420,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblocks.,"The ProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm calculation in Bunni incorrectly includes the liquidity deposited by other users, which is not owned by the protocol. This is because the deposit function is publicly callable, allowing any user to add liquidity to a token. As a result, the returned reserve will contain amounts that do not belong to the protocol.\n\nThe protocol-owned liquidity in Bunni is calculated as the sum of reserves of all BunniTokens. However, the calculation includes the reserves deposited by other users, which is not intended. This can lead to an inaccurate representation of the protocol's actual liquidity.\n\nThe issue arises from the fact that the deposit function is not restricted to protocol-owned liquidity, allowing any user to contribute to the calculation. This can result in a mix of protocol-owned and user-owned reserves being included in the calculation, leading to an incorrect representation of the protocol's liquidity."

The code excludes certain addresses from paying fees and having a maximum transaction amount, but this is done for the sake of clarity and does not create a vulnerability.",
422,There is no vulnerability in the code provided.,"The `emergencyClose()` function in the contract is responsible for repaying outstanding debts when the contract is paused due to various reasons, such as bad debts, hacking, or high volatility. The function assumes that the withdrawn amounts from GMX are always sufficient to cover the entire debt. However, this assumption is not accurate, as it does not account for the possibility of insufficient balances in the contract's token accounts.\n\nThe function's logic is flawed because it does not consider the scenario where the contract's balance of one token (e.g., tokenA) is insufficient to cover the debt, but the balance of the other token (tokenB) is not sufficient to cover the debt of tokenB. This can lead to a situation where the swap operation fails, causing the function to revert, and preventing any debt repayment.\n\nFurthermore, even if the swap is successful, the function does not account for the possibility that the balance of the token being swapped from (tokenFrom) may become less than the required amount after the swap. This can result in the `repay` call reverting when the `lendingVault` contract attempts to transfer the strategy contract for an amount greater than its balance.\n\nThe time between the `pause` action and the emergency `close` action is also a critical factor. During this period, the prices of the two assets may continue to decline, making it more likely that the `swap` is needed in almost all cases. This can lead to a situation where the `emergencyClose()` function always reverts, preventing any debt repayment.\n\nIn summary, the `emergencyClose()` function's assumptions are not accurate, and it does not account for the possibility of insufficient balances or failed swaps, which can lead to debt repayment failures."
423,"Vulnerability description:\nThe codeblock contains a vulnerability in the Solidity language.\n\nAttacking vector:\nAn attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the `shares` variable before the `if` statement is evaluated.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `shares` variable is being compared to `_maxRedeemAtEpoch(context, accountContext, account)` using the `gt` (greater than) operator. If `shares` is greater than `_maxRedeemAtEpoch(context, accountContext, account)`, the codeblock will revert the transaction.\n\nHowever, if an attacker has control over the `shares` variable, they can manipulate it to be greater than `_maxRedeemAtEpoch(context, accountContext, account)`. This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass the redemption limit and redeem more shares than they should be able to.\n\nFor example, if `_maxRedeemAtEpoch(context, accountContext, account)` is set to 100, and the attacker controls the `shares` variable, they could set it to 101. This would cause the codeblock to revert the transaction, allowing the attacker to redeem more shares than they should be able to.\n\nSolution:\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `shares` variable should not be manipulated by the attacker. One way to do this is to use a read-only modifier on the `shares` variable, which would prevent the attacker from modifying it. Another way is to use a separate storage variable for `shares` that is only accessed by the contract and not modified by the attacker.","The `BalancedVault` implementation does not account for the possibility of catastrophic failure in one of the underlying markets, which could result in permanent loss of funds deposited to the vault, including funds deposited to other markets. This is a critical issue, as the vault's design is intended to be permissionless and integrate with external price feeds, making it impossible to rule out the possibility of a market entering a state of catastrophic failure in the future.\n\nIn such a scenario, the market's oracle may stop functioning, and the market admin keys may be compromised, rendering it impossible to change the market's configuration. As a result, the vault's ability to process closing positions and withdraw collateral is severely impaired, leaving all deposited funds at risk of permanent loss.\n\nThe `BalancedVault` does not provide a mechanism for users to withdraw deposited funds through a partial emergency withdrawal from other markets, even if it means sacrificing the claim to locked funds in the event that they become available in the future. This omission is not mentioned in the documentation, leaving users unaware of the potential risks involved.\n\nFor instance, consider a vault with two markets: ETH/USD and ARB/USD. Alice deposits funds to the vault, which are split between the two markets. If the ARB/USD market undergoes a fatal failure, resulting in the `_maxRedeemAtEpoch` function returning a value of 0, Alice is unable to initiate a withdrawal process. The `redeem` function reverts with an error, citing a ""BalancedVaultRedemptionLimitExceeded"" exception, effectively trapping Alice's funds in the vault."

The vulnerability is that the function does not check if the bidder already has the NFT before transferring it.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by bidding on an NFT and then immediately transferring it to themselves. The attacker could do this by bidding on the NFT and then calling the `acceptBid` function with a signature that they control. The function would then transfer the NFT to the attacker without checking if the attacker already has it.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to control the `bidder` address and have access to the `signature` and `nftaddress` and `tokenid` values. The attacker would then call the `acceptBid` function with the signature and values, and the function would transfer the NFT to the attacker without checking if the attacker already has it.","The zAuction contract contains a vulnerability that allows a seller to accept their own bid, which is an ineffective action that triggers an event. This is because the `acceptBid` and `acceptWethBid` functions do not properly validate the bidder's identity. Specifically, the `require` statement checks whether the `bidder` variable matches the `recoveredbidder` variable, which is obtained by recovering the bidder's address from the provided signature. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a seller from accepting their own bid.\n\nIn the `acceptBid` function, the `recoveredbidder` variable is calculated using the `recover` function, which takes the hash of the message as input. The hash is calculated using the `keccak256` function, which is a cryptographic hash function. The `recover` function then attempts to recover the original message (i.e., the bidder's address) from the hash.\n\nHowever, the `recover` function can recover the original message only if the signature is valid and the message is well-formed. In the case of a seller accepting their own bid, the `recoveredbidder` variable will still match the `bidder` variable, even though the bidder is the same as the seller. This is because the `recover` function is not able to distinguish between the seller and the bidder in this case.\n\nAs a result, the `require` statement will pass, allowing the seller to accept their own bid. This is an ineffective action that triggers an event, but it is still a vulnerability because it allows the seller to manipulate the auction process."

To accomplish this, the validator must invoke the `nodeExit` function of the `SkaleManager` contract. This function only removes a single schain from the node. Consequently, the node must call the `nodeExit` function as many times as there are schains present on the node. Each iteration of this process involves iterating over every potential node that can be used as a replacement, as described in [related issue](https://github.com/ConsenSys/skale-network-audit-2020-10/issues/3).\n\nFurthermore, the initial call to `nodeExit` iterates over all schains in the node, resulting in four SSTORE operations and external calls for each schain. This may lead to a significant increase in gas consumption, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Specifically, the `_startRotation` function, which is responsible for initiating this process, performs the following operations:\n```\nConstantsHolder constants = ConstantsHolder(contractManager.getContract(""ConstantsHolder""));\nrotations[schainIndex].nodeIndex = nodeIndex;\nrotations[schainIndex].newNodeIndex = nodeIndex;\nrotations[schainIndex].freezeUntil = now.add(constants.rotationDelay());\nwaitForNewNode[schainIndex] = true;\n```\nThis could potentially hit the block gas limit, making the maximum cost of deleting a node significantly higher.

However, the `maxLoanDur(fund)` and `maxFundDur(fund)` functions are called multiple times, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.\n\nIn a reentrancy attack, the attacker calls the `maxLoanDur(fund)` and `maxFundDur(fund)` functions in a loop, which causes the `require` statements to be executed multiple times. Each time the `require` statement is executed, it transfers the fund's balance to the attacker's address. Since the attacker is calling the `maxLoanDur(fund)` and `maxFundDur(fund)` functions in a loop, the `require` statements will be executed multiple times, allowing the attacker to drain the fund's balance.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the `maxLoanDur(fund)` and `maxFundDur(fund)` functions should not be called multiple times in the `require` statements. Instead, they should be called only once at the beginning of the contract and passed as arguments to the `require` statements.","The `Funds.maxFundDur` property is intended to specify the maximum duration for which a fund should remain active. However, this restriction is bypassed when the `maxLoanDur` property is set, which allows for a loan duration exceeding the maximum fund duration. This is because the check `now + loanDur <= maxFundDur(fund)` is skipped when `maxLoanDur(fund)` is greater than 0.\n\nIn a scenario where `maxLoanDur` is set to a specific duration, such as one week, and `maxFundDur` is set to a timestamp representing a future date, like December 1st, it is possible for a loan to extend beyond the intended maximum fund duration. For instance, if the loan duration is set to end on December 7th, it would not be blocked by the `Funds.maxFundDur` restriction, despite exceeding the intended maximum duration. This vulnerability allows for the creation of loans that exceed the intended duration, potentially leading to unintended consequences."
431,"The vulnerability in this code is that it does not properly handle the case where the length of the `contractKeys` array is less than 1. In this case, the code will attempt to access an index that does not exist, which will cause a runtime error.\n\nAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by calling the `setKey` function with an empty array as the first argument, which would cause the length of the `contractKeys` array to be 0. The code would then attempt to access the first index of the array, which does not exist, causing a runtime error. The attacker could then exploit this error to gain control of the contract and carry out malicious actions.","The `Ingress` contract, which is designed to mimic the behavior of a set, has not been implemented consistently with the recent changes to the `AdminList`, `AccountRulesList`, and `NodeRulesList` contracts, which now utilize sets. This inconsistency leads to suboptimal performance in certain operations.\n\nOne notable example is the `removeContract` method, which exhibits an O(n) complexity. This is because it iterates through the `contractKeys` array, checking each element to determine if it matches the specified `name`. If a match is found, the corresponding entry in the `registry` mapping is deleted, and the last element in the array is shifted to the current position to maintain the array's integrity. This process is repeated until the end of the array is reached, resulting in a linear search.\n\nThis inefficient implementation can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, particularly in scenarios where frequent additions and removals of contracts occur."
432,"Vulnerability: The code does not properly handle the case where the owner's address is not the one calling the function.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could call the function with their own address as the owner, bypassing the `onlyOwner` modifier and potentially manipulating the buyTotalFees variable.\n\nExplanation: The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that the function can only be called by the address that owns the contract. However, this modifier does not prevent an attacker from calling the function with their own address as the owner. By doing so, the attacker could manipulate the `buyTotalFees` variable, potentially causing the contract to behave in a way that is not intended.",
433,"Vulnerability: The contract is using the AggregatorV3Interface without checking if it is actually an instance of the AggregatorV3Interface contract.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could create a contract with the same name and interface as the StableOracleWBTC contract, but with a different implementation. The attacker could then call the getPriceUSD function on their contract, which would return the attacker's address instead of the expected price. This could be used to manipulate the price of a token or steal funds from the contract.","The StableOracleWBTC contract relies on a BTC/USD Chainlink oracle to determine the price of WBTC, which can lead to significant issues if WBTC were to depeg from BTC. This is because the protocol continues to value WBTC based on the BTC/USD price, even if the bridge connecting WBTC to BTC becomes compromised and WBTC's value diverges from BTC's. This can result in the issuance of bad loans and the accumulation of bad debt, as the protocol would continue to treat WBTC as a valuable asset despite its devaluation.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the reliance on a single BTC/USD Chainlink oracle to obtain the price of WBTC. This approach is problematic because it does not account for the possibility of WBTC depegging from BTC, which could render the asset worthless. The use of the BTC/USD oracle to price WBTC poses risks to the protocol and its users, as it can lead to the issuance of bad loans and the accumulation of bad debt.\n\nThe contract's reliance on a single oracle also raises concerns about the potential for oracle manipulation or compromise, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with the depegging of WBTC."
434,There is no vulnerability in the provided Solidity codeblock.,"The `MigrateWithdrawal` function in the `migrate.go` file is responsible for transforming a LegacyWithdrawal into a Bedrock-style Withdrawal. This process involves setting a minimum gas limit for the withdrawal. However, the function's gas limit calculation is flawed, as it overestimates the required gas by setting 16 gas per data byte, whereas the Ethereum contract's overhead intrinsic gas is 4 for data bytes. This can lead to a situation where withdrawals with large data sizes (calculated gas limit higher than 30M) become unrelayable in the L1, resulting in users losing their funds."
435,"There is a vulnerability in the `_addLiquidity` function of the Solidity code. The vulnerability lies in the `ensure` modifier, which is used to enforce a deadline for the function. The issue is that the modifier does not properly handle the case where the deadline has passed.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the `_addLiquidity` function after the specified deadline has passed. The function would then proceed with the transaction, but the attacker would not be penalized for missing the deadline.\n\nTo take advantage of this vulnerability, an attacker would need to call the `_addLiquidity` function after the specified deadline has passed. The attacker could do this by manipulating the blockchain in some way, such as through a 51% attack or a reorganization of the blockchain.\n\nTherefore, the description of the vulnerability is:\n\n* Vulnerability: The `_addLiquidity` function does not properly handle the case where the specified deadline has passed, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by calling the function after the deadline has passed.\n* Attacking vector: An attacker could manipulate the blockchain in some way, such as through a 51% attack or a reorganization of the blockchain, to call the `_addLiquidity` function after the specified deadline has passed.","The createMarket transaction lacks a crucial expiration timestamp check, which can lead to unintended consequences. Specifically, the implementation of the Uniswap V2 contract's `createMarket` function does not verify whether the market creation timestamp is within the expected bounds. This oversight allows for the creation of markets at arbitrary timestamps, which can result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the `createMarket` function, the `length` variable is calculated as the difference between the `conclusion` timestamp and the current block timestamp. However, this calculation is not validated against the expected minimum market duration or the deposit interval. This means that a malicious user can create a market at a timestamp that is significantly different from the intended creation time, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, the `maxPayout` calculation is also affected by the lack of expiration timestamp check. The `maxPayout` is calculated based on the deposit interval and the length of the market, which can result in an incorrect calculation if the market is created at an unexpected timestamp. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the `purchaseBond` function, the `payout` value is calculated based on the `term.scale` and the `price`, which is adjusted for scaling. However, this calculation is not validated against the expected minimum payout amount or the `maxPayout` calculated earlier. This means that a malicious user can manipulate the payout amount by creating a market at an unexpected timestamp, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, the lack of expiration timestamp check in the `createMarket` function can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by malicious users."
436,"Vulnerability: Possible integer overflow\n\nDescription: The codeblock sets the value of `value` to `value * (10**18)`, which could result in an integer overflow if the input value is too large. This could potentially cause the program to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results.\n\nAttacking vector: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by calling the `setmaxWallet` function with a large input value, which could cause an integer overflow and potentially lead to the program producing incorrect results or behaving unexpectedly.",
