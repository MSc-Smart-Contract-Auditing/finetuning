The student's audit does not address the issues related to the expiration timestamp check, market creation timestamp, or `maxPayout` calculation mentioned in the professional auditor's report.\nCriterion 3:\nThe professional audit focuses on the lack of expiration timestamp check in the `createMarket` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. The student audit, on the other hand, identifies a vulnerability in the `addLiquidity` function, which allows an attacker to manipulate the amount of liquidity added to the pair.\n\nAlthough the two audits describe different vulnerabilities, they both identify potential security issues in the code. The student's audit lacks the same level of detail as the professional audit, but it still identifies a vulnerability that can be exploited.\n"
348,FAIL,FAIL,FAIL,FAIL,Criterion 0: FAIL\n One of the descriptions does not contain a vulnerability.
