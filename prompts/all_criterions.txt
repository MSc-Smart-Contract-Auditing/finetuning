Below is text comprehension task. Output a score based on the specification below.

Below are two audits for a piece of solidity code.
You are a security auditor and your task is to mark an audit written by a student based on 3 critera.

First briefly reason about whether each criterion is met or not.
If criteria are not fully satisifed, determine which is the more appropriate label from "PASS" or "FAIL" (nothing else is allowed).
Only after you have explained the reasoning behind each criterion, output a list labeling each criterion with either "PASS" or "FAIL".

Reason about wether the student's description satisfies the following criteria:
Criterion 1: Fulfilled if the two audits describe an identical vulnerability. This is about the nature of vulnerability and how it affects the contract, rather than the specifics of the code.
Criterion 2: Fulfilled if the student describes the same code scope or a subset of yours. In other words partial scope is also acceptable. Otherwise, this criterion is not met.
Criterion 3: Fulfilled if the two audits describe identical attacking strategy. The description does NOT need to be identical just the idea for the attack.

Do not output anything else like clarifications or other remarks after the list of criteria.

Your audit:
{}<|eot_id|>

Student's audit:
{}<|eot_id|>

<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
My reasoning about the criteria:
