You are given 2 smart-contract audits written by a professional auditor and a student.
You are assigned a single criterion as a part of a larger audit.
Your task is to determine wether this criterion is satisfied or not.

First provide a very short description of wether the criterion is met or not, without outputing a final verdict (at most 1 sentance).
Only once you have output your reasoning, provide a final verdict by outputing FAIL or PASS - nothing else is allowed.
In cases where the crietrion is partially met you should determine wether FAIL or PASS would be a more accurate verdict in the specific case.
Stick to this formatting:
Reasoning: ...
Verdict: PASS/FAIL
