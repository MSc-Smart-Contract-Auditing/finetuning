Since the function does not validate the `info` struct, the `_initiateCreamFlashLoan` function would be called with the manipulated `asset` field. This could allow the attacker to execute a flashloan to an arbitrary address, potentially stealing funds or manipulating the contract's state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The vulnerability is not directly exploitable, as the `onFlashLoan` function checks the `msg.sender` and `sender` addresses before executing the flashloan.

      "The `onlyEOAEx` modifier is designed to restrict calls to a function or contract to only be initiated by an externally-owned account (EOA), as opposed to a smart contract. This is typically achieved by checking the `tx.origin` variable, which is supposed to identify the original sender of the transaction as an EOA. However, the introduction of EIP 3074, which introduces the `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL` instructions, poses a challenge to this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `AUTH` instruction allows a smart contract to delegate control of an EOA to itself, effectively bypassing the `tx.origin` check. This means that even if a smart contract is authorized to act on behalf of an EOA, it can still use the `onlyEOAEx` modifier to make calls, which would be misinterpreted as coming from the EOA itself. As a result, the `tx.origin` check, which is currently used to ensure that calls are only made from EOsAs, may no longer be reliable in the presence of EIP 3074.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "The `tx.origin` variable returns the address that initiated the transaction, which can be different from the `msg.sender` if the transaction is relayed through a contract. For example, if a contract calls another contract, which then calls the current contract, `msg.sender` would be the contract that made the intermediate call, while `tx.origin` would be the original caller.\n",

      "An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a contract that relays the call to the current contract. The attacker can then call the contract, and since `msg.sender` would be the contract that made the intermediate call, not the original attacker, the condition `msg.sender!= tx.origin` would not be met, allowing the attacker to bypass the check.\n",
